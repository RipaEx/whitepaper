\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{Ripa Exchange is a hybrid-decentralized exchange with a strong focus on lowering the entry level
of opening new exchanges and giving crypto traders safe and secure trading partners to operate on a daily basis.}\\

The team of Ripa Exchange believes that, despite the recent developments in the world of
cryptocurrencies, it is still expensive to open, manage and build trust on a newly created exchange not
only for the resources need to run a reliable exchange platform but also for the build of the platform 
itself and to find the liqudity necessary to run a profitable business in the first 3-5 year gap.\\

Action is needed and action is needed now. Users are frustrated with unreliable exchanges that run away
with their funds, got hacked or does not sustain the load of a growing industry like this is. Despite
the effort of exchanges managers to offer efficient, reliable, and easy to use platforms to trade entry
prices for building such platforms is in the rage of five-six hundered thousand dollars and that does not 
include personnel cost to give platinum customer support, platform infrastructure and daily expenses for
the business. All of that for then having an decent exchange platform for which you will need to pay an 
external software company to make changes as you request.\\

It is the aim of this project to give you an Open Source, efficient, reliable exchange platform and to
give the needed liquidity\footnote{Thank you to the RLSP (Ripa Liquidity Service Provider) technology} to your newly created 
exchange from day \textbf{one} so you can focus on finding your customers, give platinum support and comply with all the eterogeneus 
laws in the industry. As we want that the customer experience will be the best (the sleekest) as possible while making them safer to trade.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
- The industry of virtual currencies has (a high entry level from a technical point of view for the average user
and) an high entry level from an economical point of view for the average entrepreneur for buying a reliable cryptocurrency 
exchange source code, to hire professional DevOps personnel, to hire customer support operatives, to comply with national and 
international AML/KYC regulations to have liquidity from day one of the exchanges operations. We want to lower this entry level because
\textbf{running an exchange is HARD} and we want you to focus on things that matters not of caveauts that the industry require because
you want to start to make business in this industry and you need the source code to do it.

To strenghten that there is the point that starting an exchange require an high level of investments form your venture capital 
and also with that the profit of your exchanges operations are not guaranteed in the first 5 years timespan.

For building a professional exchange services we think that the source code of your exchange and the liquidity to offer to your clients
from day one should be given to you free of charge: no more paying \$150,000.00 to a company just to have a platform that works and for
which you need to pay another \$100,000.00 - 150,000.00 just to brand it and customize as for your needs so you can tide your 
business to a company that may go bankarupt in the future and found you in trouble as you never had the source code of the product
your business rely on.

\textbf{We believe that all of this should be free} and we should offer you the best technology in the market so you can focus on your business
while we focus on building the technology to run your business in an efficient, secure, responsive and productive way. That is why Ripa Exchange 
is focusing on building a network of exchanges focusing on an exchange architecture that is \textit{efficient, secure, UI responsive, compliant and customizable}
so each exchange in the network can rely on solid foundations while customising its single exchange instance for the needs 
the business entity of that particular exchange installation needs.

For reaching that goal we choosen to build our Ripa Liquidity Service Provider technology on top of ARK - a blockchain for consumer adoption - 
which primary focus is increasing consumer adoption for blockchain technologies focusing on two critical areas: \underline{A Fast Secure Core Technology}
and \underline{Practical Services for Real People}. ARK ecosystem is still at its early stage of development: in current implementation 
there is the possibility to run smart contracts natively on the ARK 2.0 blockchain, this will permits this blockchain tecnology to compete 
with Ethereum from a thecnological point of view.

The Ripa Founder Team (RFT), as presented on ripaex.io, acts in the name of the Ripa Crew. The RFT is responsible for the proper use of 
funds collected under the Token Exchange Campaign (RIPA - TEC) presented below in this document.

The RFT undertakes that the result of this TEC will be used exclusively for the financing of the \emph{Ripa Exchange} project as explained in this 
whitepaper - which will be made available on the collection platform: tec.ripaex.io - and which should result in the creation of a 
legal entity whose name will be \emph{Ripa Exchange}. The creation of this company is scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.

To this end, RFT intervenes on behalf of \emph{Ripa Exchange, a company in the process of being incorporated}.

\section{Roadmap}\index{Roadmap}
There are essentially four phases to the RipaEx project:
\begin{description}
	\item[Funding the project: XPX presale and RIPA TEC (WP2)] This phase recognises the existence of interest in this market development
	from across the World concerning the lowering of the entry level for building a cryptocurrency exchange.
	It aims to make the first comprehensive analysis of this state of the art to form the basis of the later project phases and
	build the first working prototype of a centralized exchange based on Peatio.    
	\item[First exchange opening and development of tools and resources (WP3)] The second phase takes the results of the first 
	and develops from them a set of tools and resources which provide concise and comprehensible guidance to market actors in any
	Country. With the first instance of Ripa Exchange running first contacts with other economical players in the industry can be
	done.
	\item[Development of hybrid-decentralized exchange (WP 4-6)] Using the tools and resources developed in WP3, 
	Work packages 4-6 focus on bringing collected knowledge and tools into practice. The three work packages reflect three major
	focal points (and target groups) within the network of exchange created for establishing successful 
	demonstrations on local scale: incorporations of local Ripa Exchanges (WP4), technical analysis for the 
	Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (WP5), and first MVP of the hybrid decentralized exchange (WP6). The demonstration
    phase forms the heart of the RipaEx action; WP 2 and 3 are focused on providing
    deliverables (e.g. tools) that enable successful and efficient demonstration activities.    
	\item[Dissemination (WP 7/8) and Project Coordination (WP1)] During the full duration of the project, 
	dissemination activities (WP 7/8) are carried out in which results from the individual work packages are disseminated 
	to relevant target groups including project partners, RipaEx supporters, exchanges managers, banking partners as well 
	as relevant target groups. This phase covers a wide range of dissemination techniques, from printed and
    electronic handbooks to workshops and training sessions, ongoing networks, all having the
	ultimate goal of defining a standard for exchanges communication among public and private entities. 
	An overarching work package is concerned with the management of the project from start to finish, ensuring proper coordination, 
	quality assurance and budgetary control (WP1).
