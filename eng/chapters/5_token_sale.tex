\chapter{Token Sale}
\section{Introduction}
The RipaEx XPX token sale will be separated into two phases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textsc{PreSale}}: that will run from April to June 2018
		\item \textbf{\textsc{RIPA TEC}}: that will run from July to December 2018
	\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
You can easily refer to both phases PreSale and RIPA TEC as \textit{RipaEx ICO}.

\subsection{Exchange Rate \& Accepted Cryptocurrencies}
During the token sale the exchange rate for the XPX tokens will be \textbf{\PHP/\euro0.10}.\\

The following cryptocurrencies are accepted: \textbf{BTC, ETH, ARK, LISK}.\\

If you want to send us a different cryptocurrency send us your choice and we will tell you immediately if we can make 
the exchange and how to execute the operation in detail (receiving address, exchange rate, quantity)\\

\textsc{Exchange rate is Bitstamp last and is valid 60 minutes from quote}.

\subsection{Bonus for Investors and for new Users}
For all investors in the RipaEx ICO will be given \euro1,000.00 credit in trading commissions 
in the first Ripa Exchange instance running, while a bonus of \PHP1,000.00 will be given
to all new registered users during the RipaEx ICO to use at your own will.

Coins distribution will be available at the end of each trading day and performed automatically through the RIPA TEC platform. Minimum
threshold to reach is 25 BTC.\\

\textsc{As the XPX exchange rate is calculated against the euro currency directly you are guaranteed to not loose any invested fund
during the sale period as the XPX tokens will be listed on our exchanges at the beginning of 2019 directly with the same \textbf{\PHP/\euro0.10}
exchange rate agreed during the token sale-ICO phase}.\\
