\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{Ripa Exchange is a hybrid-decentralized exchange with a strong focus on lowering the entry level
of opening new exchanges and giving crypto traders safe and secure trading partners to operate on a daily basis.}\\

The team of RipaEx believes that, despite the recent developments in the world of
cryptocurrencies, it is still expensive to open, manage and build trust on a newly created exchange not
only for the resources need to run a reliable exchange platform but also for the build of the platform 
itself and to find the liquidity necessary to run a profitable business in the first 5 years gap.\\

Action is needed and action is needed now. Users are frustrated with unreliable exchanges that run away
with their funds, got hacked or does not sustain the load of a growing industry of today. Despite
the effort of exchanges managers to offer efficient, reliable, and easy to use platforms to trade entry
prices for building such platforms is in the rage of 250-300 thousand euro and that does not 
include personnel cost to give platinum customer support, platform infrastructure and daily expenses for
the business. All of that for then having an decent exchange platform for which you will need to pay an 
external software company to make changes as you request.\\

It is the aim of this project to give you an Open Source, efficient, reliable exchange platform and to
give the needed liquidity\footnote{Thank you to the RLSP (Ripa Liquidity Service Provider) technology} to your newly created 
exchange from day \textbf{one} so you can focus on finding your customers, give platinum support and comply with all the heterogeneous 
laws in the industry. 
As we want that the customer experience will be the sleekest possible, while making it safer to trade.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
The industry of virtual currencies has a high bar to entry from a technical point of view for the average user
and a high bar to entry from an economical point of view for the average entrepreneur for buying a reliable crypto 
exchange source code, hiring professional DevOps personnel, hiring customer support specialists, complying with national and 
international AML/KYC regulations and having liquidity from day one of the exchange start of operations. 
We want to lower this barrier because to entry this industry because \textbf{running an exchange is HARD} 
and we want you to focus on things that matter, not on the caveats that the industry requires because
you want to start a business in this industry and you need the source code to do it.

To addition to this point, starting an exchange requires a high level of investment form your venture capital reference
and the profit of your exchanges operations are not guaranteed in the first 5 years.

When building a professional exchange service we think that the source code of your exchange and the liquidity to offer to your clients
from day one should be given to you free of charge: no more paying \euro150,000.00 to a company just to have a platform that works and for
which you need to pay another \euro100,000.00 - 150,000.00 just to brand it and customize it for your needs so you can tie your 
business to a company that may go bankrupt in the future and found you in trouble as you never had the source code of the product
your business relies on.

\textbf{We believe that all of this should be free} and we should offer you the best technology in the market so you can focus on your business
while we focus on building the technology to run your business in an efficient, secure, responsive and productive way. That is why RipaEx 
is focusing on building a network of exchanges focusing on an exchange architecture that is \textit{efficient, secure, UI responsive, compliant and customizable}
so each exchange in the network can rely on solid foundations while customizing its single exchange instance for the needs of
the business entity and having its customization easily accessible to you.

For reaching that goal, we chosen to build our Ripa Liquidity Service Provider technology on top of ARK - a blockchain for consumer adoption - 
which primary focus is increasing consumer adoption for blockchain technologies focusing on two critical areas: \underline{A Fast Secure Core Technology}
and \underline{Practical Services for Real People}. ARK ecosystem is still at its early stage of development: in future implementations 
there will be the possibility to run smart contracts natively on the ARK 2.0 blockchain, this will permits this blockchain technology to compete 
with Ethereum from a technological point of view. RLSP will permits to share the same liquidity-orderbook to each exchange in the Ripa Network based on
single exchange installation privacy rules and preferences in the admin area of your individual exchange instance.

The Ripa Founder Team (RFT), as presented on ripaex.io, acts in the name of the Ripa Crew. The RFT is responsible for the proper use of 
funds collected under the Token Exchange Campaign (RIPA - TEC) presented below in this document.

The RFT undertakes that the result of this TEC will be used exclusively for the financing of the \emph{RipaEx} project as explained in this 
whitepaper - which will be made available on the collection platform: tec.ripaex.io - and which should result in the creation of a 
legal entity whose name will be \emph{RipaEx}. The creation of this company is scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.

To this end, RFT intervenes on behalf of \emph{RipaEx, a company in the process of being incorporated}.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[roadmapBox,
		title=\textbf{\textsc{Funding the project: XPX PreSale and RIPA TEC (WP2)}}]

		This phase recognizes the existence of interest in this market development
		from across the World concerning the lowering of the entry level for building a cryptocurrency exchange.
		It aims to make the first comprehensive analysis of this state of the art to form the basis of the later project phases and
		build the first working prototype of a centralized exchange based on Peatio.\\

		During the full duration of the project, 
		dissemination activities (WP 7/8) are carried out in which results from the individual work packages are disseminated 
		to relevant target groups including project partners, RipaEx investors, exchanges managers, banking partners as well 
		as relevant target groups. This phase covers a wide range of dissemination techniques, from printed and
		electronic handbooks to workshops and training sessions, hackatons, ongoing networks, all having the
		ultimate goal of defining a standard for exchange communication among public and private entities. 
		An overarching work package is concerned with the management of the project from start to finish, 
		ensuring proper coordination, quality assurance and budgetary control (WP1).

		Using the tools and resources developed in WP3, 
		Work packages 4-6 focus on bringing collected knowledge and tools into practice. The three work packages reflect three major
		focal points (and target groups) within the network of exchanges created for establishing successful 
		demonstrations on a local scale: incorporations of local Ripa Exchanges (WP4), technical analysis for the 
		Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (WP5), and first MVP of the hybrid decentralized exchange (WP6). The demonstration
		phase forms the heart of the RipaEx action; WP 2 and 3 are focused on providing
		deliverables (e.g. tools) that enable successful and efficient demonstration activities.\\

\section{RipaEx Partners - RipaEx Governance}\index{RipaEx Partners - RipaEx Governance}
Most of the partners are entrepreneurs in the virtual currency industry, but a research institute 
and Financial Organizations are also represented. The partners are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Coordinator}: RipaEx SCIC 
	\item \textbf{CoBeneficiaries}: Ripa Exchange Ltd
\end{itemize}
\todo{TODO: Add RipaEx partners here}
\subsection{RipaEx Governance}\index{RipaEx Governance}
Creation of a new Ripa Exchange in the Ripa network, release of RCF funds for the creation of new exchanges will be
decided with a majority voting system among all the delegates of the Ripa network. The customization of the individual
exchange instance, otherwise, will be decided exclusively from the company that manages that single exchange
instance.

The RipaEx project will be incorporated as a collective interest company for profit as soon as the Ripa Blockchain
will be stable, instead the company Ripa Exchange Ltd will manage the first individual crypto asset marketplace
instance that will be opened to public in the first quarter of 2019.

\section{Project Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{\textsc{what}}: RipaEx is a project to facilitate the uptake of standards to share liquidity between crypto assets marketplaces. 
	The objective of RipaEx is the promotion of shared source code for wallets and exchanges in the virtual currency industry: 
	it is the aim of this reference document to give in-depth information to prospective exchange developers,
	or exchange managers, to enable correct decision-making and to ensure success for their proposed projects. 
	It seeks to analyze the real potential in the Country of application for a network of cryptocurrency exchanges, 
	and its place in the market.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{what}}: crypto assets are an alternative to centralized assets managed by (country-specific) stock exchanges. 
	Although certain stock exchanges gives the possibility to their users to verify and manage the assets they own, the verification process
	is not always transparent, that is the reason because from 2009 \cite{bitcoin} onwards a new types of (community-verifiable) assets 
	have been implemented to give small, medium and big investors complete transparency in the managing of their investments
	assets.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{when}}: recent developments at European Union level and worldwide are transforming both how virtual currencies
	are treated and the way ICO (Initial Coin Offering) are legislated. These combined developments 
	have made the use and production of virtual currencies an increasingly favorable prospect. \\
	In October 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are exempt from VAT taxation. \\
	In July 2016 the European Commission adopted proposals for legislation to amend the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) that
	will bring virtual currencies exchanged and wallet providers into the EU's anti-money laundering framework \cite{EUAMLCrypto}.\\
	In February 2018 the European Commission launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum \cite{EUBOaF} to highlight key developments 
	in blockchain technology, promote European actors and reinforce European engagement with multiple stakeholders involved in blockchain activities.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{why}}: however there is still very little regulation performed on ICOs and only United States of America at the moment has undergone
	a legislation defining ICO tokens as securities and property. \cite{SECICO}
	\item \textbf{\textsc{who}}: the results indicate that medium tech savvy from 18 to 45 is the average user of
	virtual currencies although the corporate finance companies are also starting to put 
	virtual currencies schemes inside their portfolio especially since the presentation 
	of the Bitcoin futures contract from CME Group Inc. in the stock exchange of Chicago
	last 18th of December 2017.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how much}}: total virtual currencies market capitalization has been estimated around 317 B USD\footnote{Coinmarketcap data April 2018}
	and is predicted to grow to 5,000 B USD in the next ten years span \cite{cryptoMCTenYears}.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{where}}: local authorities are working with National Governments to make sure local exchangers
	in the national territory are complying with national and international AML/KYC regulations.
	Venture capitals and Angel Investors are starting to release financing solutions to start-ups 
	in the Fintech industry all over the world from America to Asia passing through Europe and some 
	Countries are starting state-owned cryptocurrencies schemes to test the exchange of goods \& services
	on those (distributed ledger) technologies \cite{petro}.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how much}}: the average cost for starting your own crypto asses marketplace is around \euro 150,000.00 only 
	for a running instance of your exchange platform:
	to that you need to add costs to customize the platform before launch and in the future, advertise your new business, running costs for servers,
	network operators, support center staff and legal department to comply with your State AML/KYC legislations and general company laws.\\
	\textbf{That is the reason because we think owning the source code of your exchange software is the best way to run a business in this industry}.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how}}: the main problems encountered in opening a FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO marketplace is to find trusted
	banking partners to comply with the many different AML/KYC rule and procedures to exchange virtual currencies
	to FIAT currencies.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{what}}: classical types of exchange operations are: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{one-way exchange}: in which a centralized application has all the liquidity to offer to its potential users
			\item \textbf{two-way exchange}: in which a centralized or decentralized platform match the selling requests with the buying requests
			of its users
		\end{itemize}
		On this, a sub-classification is also necessary:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange}: in which exchange operations are performed between 
			FIAT\footnote{Traditional central banks owned currencies like EUR, USD, GBP, JPY, others...} 
			currencies and virtual currencies
			\item \textbf{CRYPTO $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange}: in which exchange operations are performed only between virtual currencies
		\end{itemize}
	You can build a matrix based on the four configurations above to build the exchange operation platform of your needs.

		\tcboxfit{\tcbfontsize{0.8} exchange without banking partnership}
	\end{tcbraster}	

	\item \textbf{\textsc{with what}}: the specifications to look when choosing for an exchange platform to run are:
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{Code}: Open Source, Closed Source or hybrid solution between the two
			\item \textbf{Modularization}: separation between exchange engine (orders matching engine), UI and user registry
			\item \textbf{UI responsiveness}: responsiveness of UI on all devices (desktop and mobile)
			\item \textbf{Compliance}: with current industry standards and rules \& regulations
			\item \textbf{Customization}: of the exchange engine, trading currencies, UI and other aspects of the crypto asset marketplace platform
			\item \textbf{Security} of the funds: saving in cold wallets and hot wallets configurable
			\item \textbf{Transparency} of the funds: proof of solvency of the exchange
			\item \textbf{Multi-Accounts trading}: easy to configure new virtual currency protocols
			\item \textbf{Multi-Accounts users}: possibility to interact with user accounts from Google, Facebook, Twitter 
			to login into the platform and FIDO Alliance security standards for personal credentials
		\end{enumerate}	
	\textbf{Those are not only technical decisions to be made but also economical} especially the owning of the source code of your crypto asset
	marketplace platform is fundamental to make future customization of your exchange in an independent way compared to rely on a single
	software house that makes the customizations for you at a high cost.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how}}: options for finding users for your exchange operations are: targeted marketing campaigns, innovative features in the industry,
	fee level based on trading quantities, bonuses for first registration and trading quantities, affiliate marketing for paying users to bring their friends
	to your exchange.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how}}: for setting-up a crypto asset marketplace a project must take into account the following legislation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{AML/KYC}: \textit{Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive} if business set up in the European Union \cite{4AMLD} or the AML/KYC reference implementation
			to your crypto asset marketplace Country of incorporation (as an example \textit{Intelligence Reform \& Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004}
			written by FinCEN in the United States of America).\\
			International recommendations for undergoing AML/CFT verifications are given by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering \cite{FATF}.
			\item \textbf{Payment Licence}: by far the biggest and most arduous task with regards to legitimising the 
			FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange operations is obtaining a \textit{PSD Licence} \cite{PSD}. 
			The PSD license follows Council Directive 2007/64/EC and is applied in each country via its own national laws. 
			Costs of an PSD license can vary between hundred thousand euro to one order of magnitude greater depending on the exchange volume.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\textsc{who}}: the nature of the business under consideration by the RipaEx project (small scale,
	localized FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchanges operations), means that each enterprise likely to have 7 or 8 staff: N.2 developers, 
	N.1 network/security operator, N.1 administrative, N.2 client support operators, N.1 legal and tax advisor. \\
	The turnover of such an enterprise however, because of the high value of the end product, is likely to be more than 
	\euro 350,000 a year and could be several times higher. A business of
	this scale lends itself to the following possible company structures: A simple partnership;
	A limited company; A non-profit company or social enterprise; A worker co-operative.
	Financial Agencies are potential key actors, but the type of business they can set up will
	depend on their legal status which does vary from country to country.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how}}: potential sources of funds for a small-medium sized crypto asset marketplaces are: Bank Loans; Low
	Interest Loan Schemes; Commercial Credit; Equity financing; Business Angels venture
	capital. Having a robust Business Plan and financial guarantees are essential elements
	for securing funding. The European Investment Fund (EIF) of the European Investment Bank (EIB), 
	offers support in the form of guarantees for SMEs.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{why}}: the arguments for crypto asset marketplaces are for financial freedom,
	decentralizing of the value-transferring operations, and real ownership of your money. 
	There are other benefits, well documented, such as faster payments, long term gain based on deflationary economy and prediction of 
	Great Depressions like the one that hit the global economy in 2008. But
	above all, virtual currencies are the only direct competitor to centralized value-transferring operations done by central banks.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{why}}: there is consensus in the literature that the use of virtual currencies in place of fiat currencies will result in 
	higher financial freedom especially as they fit into the Austrian school of economy \cite{austrianTheory} for lots of economic experts
	\cite{misesItalia}, although bitcoin is it better used as means of payment and is lacking the stability to be a healthy
	reserve of value.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{why}}: benefits of virtual currencies schemes like bitcoin are in a deflationary economy, in limited emission of money,
	in near instant and without border value transfer operations, in relative anonymity and in the separation between the entities 
	that produce the money (miners) from the entities that code the economic theory behind it (developers).
	\item \textbf{\textsc{how}}: securing assets on the blockchains means basically performing three operations
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{Generating a random private key}
			\item \textbf{Converting the private key generated in (1) into a public key}: a common protocol making this conversion
			in the virtual currencies industry is the ECDSA curve algorithm
			\item \textbf{Converting the public key generated in (2) into a virtual currency address}: common protocols for making this conversion
			are hash functions SHA-256, Base58 encoding, Base32 encoding
		\end{enumerate}
	At this point any value sent to the virtual currency address generated in (3) is secured on the blockchain of choice and accessible
	only from the owner of the relative private key generated in (1).
	\item \textbf{\textsc{where}}: the two critical factors affecting the cryptocurrency industry are competion from banks and 
	State legislation (bans, etc).
	Although a harmonization throughout Europe would be beneficial to development of the industry both in terms of 
	taxation and warranty approvals, this is currently not the case. Each country worldwide has its specific legislation and tax
	regime for all exchanges operations involving FIAT money, and State banning is going to completely liberalization 
	of this activities like European Union to complete banning and imprisonment of operators in this industry like Bangladesh
	\cite{bitcoinLegality}. 
	\item \textbf{\textsc{where}}: the Asiatic countries of South Korea, China and Japan are the leader in the field of cryptocurrencies for number of 
	transactions for over 9 years with a proactive approach and favorable tax regime. At the beginning of 2017 in Japan bitcoin
	has been declared legal tender but China has recently declared illegal token sale and exchanges and local cryptocurrencies
	marketplaces are closing down.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{where}}: any assessment of your local market should include: number of potential users to reach, 
	type of exchange to incorporate (FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO or CRYPTO $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO), type of virtual currencies protocol 
	to integrate (POW, DPOS, Masternodes, others...), types of services to offer (exchange only, advanced trading tools,
	payment processor, others...), if FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange number of FIAT payments processors to accept (PayPal, OKPay,
	MoneyPolo, others...), number of others exchanges in your region.
	\item \textbf{\textsc{who}}: there are a number of options for dealing with Warranty/Customer protection issues: 
	creating consumer pressure by making clear to the end users that the possession of the private keys of their
	virtual currency addresses make \textbf{liable} for any loss of the private keys meaning nobody can help
	them recovering their funds if the their private keys are lost. Creating consumer pressure to not leave funds
	on exchanges (``\textit{Be Your own Bank!!}''), making them choose the licensed exchanges in the market. 
	\item \textbf{\textsc{who}}: while it is very expensive to insure money exchanges operations and money transmitting operations, 
	examples of customer protections in the industry are: Kraken platform which is offering Mt. Gox users partial refund
	of their lost, BitFinex exchange has launched the BFX token to repay users for the lost of 120,000 bitcoin 
	(valued \$72,000,000 at the time of the hacking) caused by the change in the wallet configuration done by the exchange
	itself, Ethereum did a network fork on the block height 1,920,000 to stop the lost of ETH funds from The DAO, Decentralized
	Autonomous Organization that had a bug that permits users to claim their ETH back using recurrency in The DAO codebase,
	other hacking cases...
	\item \textbf{\textsc{Recommendations for all/law compliance}}: if you intend to incorporate a FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO 
	exchange you should
	focus from the first instance on law compliance by studying the AML/KYC laws of the country of incorporation and

\section{Towards a Decentralized Exchange...}
Ripa Exchange is a centralized exchange which will be converted into an hybrid-decentralized exchange to create a network of exchanges
that share the same liquidity between each of them so you can offer liquidity from day 1 of your exchanges operations.\\

To offer the PROs of a centralized exchange like platinum customer support and FIAT exchange, with all the PROs of a 
decentralized exchange like liquidity, without the CONs of both of them, 
we need to perform an intermediate step where Ripa Exchange will be converted into an hybrid-decentralized exchange 
and during phase 3 of our project (WP4-6) we will make all the functional and technical analysis required 
to make the next step on solid ground and offer to the RipaEx community an open source, secure and efficient exchange.

%	CHAPTER 4: Ripa Blockchain
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapterimage{chapter_head_4_Dubai.jpg} % Chapter heading image
\chapter{The Ripa Blockchain}
\label{sec:theRipaBlockchain}
The RipaEx project will have its own blockchain called Ripa which will be run on the DPOS protocol and has the XPX 
token (\PHP symbol) running on it that will serve the five following purposes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to list new cryptocurrencies on Ripa Exchanges
		\item to advertise new projects
		\item to buy RipaEx gadget on the RipaEx Store
		\item to pay for the sell of goods \& services on authorized resellers with our RipaEx POS (Point of Sale)
		\item to share liquidity between Ripa Exchanges in the same network
	\end{enumerate}

Ripa (XPX or \PHP) is a cryptocurrency derivate from ARK, Lisk, Crypti and BitShares with unique differences and improvements
for reaching the goal of shared liquidity between exchanges in the same Ripa network. This code however inherits the 
simplified interactions between ARK and other blockchain systems using DPoS as their consensus. This homogeneous codebase
allows for the potential to provide service bridges in the form of ARK-Lisk blockchain apps, along with any other additional 
systems provided by their blockchain administrators.

\vspace{5mm}
\textsc{\textbf{Ripa blockchain is an ARK fork and the use of a blockchain technology for the network of exchanges created will complete
the ripa ecosystem by permitting each exchange in the ripa network to share the same liquidity. We will always entrust ARK as our 
blockchain technology provider to merge their code into our latest features for what concerning the RIPA Blockchain}}

\vspace{5mm}

Explained the use of the Ripa Blockchain in the RipaEx ecosystem and explained the RIPA - ARK technological relations what is 
following are the specifications of the Ripa Blockchain derived/inherited from ARK.

\section{Delegated Proof of Stake Technology}
Ripa Blockchain, will inherits the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus system that was first introduced
by BitShares. This consensus algorithm was designed to eliminate the issues associated with Proof of Work (PoW), 
namely the centralization of computing power and the exponentially increasing waste of real world energy. While not
completely decentralized as it relies on consensus by a fixed number of elected delegates, it guarantees a better decentralization 
than Bitcoin. The consensus algorithm implementation is improved over time, evolving into an optimal consensus system.\\

The technical description of the Ripa blockchain is as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 101 active forging Delegates
		\item Delegates selected by vote mechanism built into DPoS
		\item 115,000,000 XPX - Seeded Genesis Block
	\end{itemize}
	\item Multi-signature accounts
	\item Constant block reward
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2 \PHP per block
		\item Inflation Rate (with 8s block times)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 6.31\% for the first year
			\item 5.93\% the 2nd year
			\item 4.02\% the 10th year
		\end{itemize}
		\item 8-second block time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Decreased block time possible with future upgrades to the core.
		\end{itemize}
		\item 25 transactions per block
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Increased via soft fork as needed.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Routing tables
	\item SmartBridge data field for custom use and bridging blockchains (ARK Contract Execution Service)
	\item Batch transactions\footnote{Future upgrade: when ARK 2.0 will be released \label{note1}}
	\item Custom transaction fees\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]
	\item Native smart contract execution\footnote{Future upgrade: when ARK Virtual Machine will be released}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5mm}
\textsc{\textbf{As said Ripa blockchain is an ARK fork and we will entrust ARK as our blockchain technology provider to merge their 
code into our latest features for what concerning the RIPA Blockchain}}, features like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Scaling network} up to the level of major Credit Card networks with core upgrades
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Increasing the number of Forging Delegates
		\item Increasing the Block Size to include more transactions
		\item Implementation of pre-approval PBFT block concept testnet [codename:
		TwinChain]
		\item Routing tables, to minimize hops among nodes when blocks are broadcast
		\item Include forging with RIPA Uncles.	
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Two node types} is used to secure the RIPA network:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Relay nodes} - Nodes with full API functionality, acting as a back-end for the
		feature rich lite clients. Relay nodes do not collect any transaction fee and do
		not have the ability to Forge RIPA Blocks.
		\item \textbf{Forging nodes} - Nodes with reduced API functionality, decreasing the
		exposure to potential DDoS attacks on the RIPA Platform. Forging nodes are
		able to Forge RIPA and receive transaction fees.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Official lite client} for network access is be provided shortly before the mainnet
	launch including desktop clients (Windows, MacOS, and Linux) and mobile clients
	(Android and iOS).
	\item \textbf{OffLine wallet creation}: the network itself does not use a Graphical User Interface by default. Any RIPA
	account can be created off-line and managed at no cost with a single device
	(computer, mobile phone, embedded ARM, IoT).
\end{itemize}

\section{Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets (BIP32)}
The structure of the public and private key generation follows the same specification
as Bitcoin. A custom implementation of BIP32 for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
is provided to RIPA users.

\section{Fees}
The fee for standard transactions is set at \PHP0.1 but the will be flexible in future releases of Ripa Blockchain.
At mainnet launch, a fee structure is provided out of the box to forging delegates with the following rules:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Transaction \PHP0.1
		\item Vote \PHP1 (101 votes per transaction)
		\item Second Signature \PHP1
		\item Multi Signature \PHP1 per signature + \PHP1 per signing account
		\item Registering a delegate \PHP25.
	\end{itemize}
All fees are paid to the forging node which processes the block containing those fees.

\section{Ripa Delegates and Delegate Voting}
Any node running the core blockchain code wishing to become a forging node must
register their account within the RIPA network. The fee for this registration is set to
25 \PHP per delegate account registered.
RIPA incorporates a new DPoS voting system originally envisioned by the Crypti
Founders. The RIPA system fee is 1 \PHP per delegate vote. The voting weight of each
wallet will be split evenly between all delegates voted. For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If a wallet votes for one delegate, that delegate receives 100\% of the wallets
voting weight.
	\item If that wallet votes for an additional delegate, the entire vote weight is split
evenly between the two delegates at 50\%.
	\item By adding a third delegate, the voting weight splits again, and each of the
three delegates receives 33.333\% of the voting weight from that wallet.
\end{itemize}

The 101 forging nodes with the highest number of votes are eligible to Forge RIPA
blocks. This design eliminates the possibility that any single large RIPA holder or an
organization holding large percentages of RIPA are able to gain control over the
entire network by voting for all of their nodes into forging positions, thus effectively
taking complete control over that DPoS Blockchain. Votes from XPX Tokens held by
RIPA Crew may be used at RIPA Crew's discretion.

\section{Connecting Blockchains}
\subsection{ARK Bridged Blockchains (SmartBridge Technology)}
The ARK Platform does not provide direct support for sidechains or dapp databases.
Instead, a mechanism to bridge together blockchains is provided via a bridging
function built into ARK Core where any blockchain can send and receive trigger
function notices and informational data through the primary ARK network via
custom developed \textbf{SmartBridge(s)} and \textbf{Encoded Listeners}.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{ARKSmartBridge}
	\captionof{figure}{ARK SmartBridge Technology}
\end{center}

\subsection{A.C.E.S. - ARK Contract Execution Service}
ACES is a blockchain interoperability platform that provides simple protocols and tools for building a robust blockchain 
service marketplace.

ACES is composed mainly of the following three components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Listeners} ACES Listeners provide a way for all the different blockchain transaction events to be easily 
	consumed via a common REST-ful API. The API allows consumers to create subscriptions and receive blockchain events 
	in real-time using Webhook callbacks.
	\item \textbf{Services} ACES Services create and execute Service Contracts, which can be anything from uploading 
	a file to a storage blockchain, performing value transfers, creating smart contracts, executing code on 
	blockchain based computing platforms, or interacting with IoT hardware.
	\item \textbf{Marketplace Console} The ACES Marketplace Console is a consumer dashboard for searching and executing 
	service contracts listed on the Marketplace. ACES Service providers can list their service nodes using the Marketplace API.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{ACES}
	\captionof{figure}{ARK-BTC A.C.E.S. SmartBridge Implementation Overview}
\end{center}

\section{Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (R.L.S.P)}
Using the SmartBridge technology RipaEx will build a mechanism to share liquidity between all the exchanges in the Ripa network
by writing the single exchange orderbook in the Ripa Blockchain and by executing order matching between all exchanges in the network.

In this way you can have the benefits of a decentralized orderbook (like liquidity) with the benefits of a centralized exchange (like
platinum customer support and FIAT exchange).

\section{Ripa Community Fund}
To permits the birth of new exchanges in the Ripa network a Ripa Community Fund - RCF - is created with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Starting Principal}: the RCF will have a starting operating capital of 5\% (5,750,000 \PHP) of the genesis block
	\item \textbf{Recurring Participation}: each delegate will contribute to the RCF with 5\% of its forged XPXs
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
To obtain funds from the RCF to start your own Ripa Exchange you will submit your proposal in the official RCF section in the Ripa forum at
anytime after the first Ripa Exchange instance will be operational.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	CHAPTER 5: Token Sale
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapterimage{chapter_head_5_Tokyo.jpg} % Chapter heading image
\chapter{Token Sale}
\section{Introduction}
The RipaEx XPX token sale will be separated into two phases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textsc{PreSale}}: that will run from April to June 2018
		\item \textbf{\textsc{RIPA TEC}}: that will run from July to December 2018
	\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
You can easily refer to both phases PreSale and RIPA TEC as \textit{RipaEx ICO}.

\subsection{Exchange Rate \& Accepted Cryptocurrencies}
During the token sale the exchange rate for the XPX tokens will be \textbf{\PHP/\euro0.10}.\\

The following cryptocurrencies are accepted: \textbf{BTC, ETH, ARK, LISK}.\\

If you want to send us a different cryptocurrency send us your choice and we will tell you immediately if we can make 
the exchange and how to execute the operation in detail (receiving address, exchange rate, quantity)\\

\textsc{Exchange rate is Bitstamp last and is valid 60 minutes from quote}.

\subsection{Bonus for Investors and for new Users}
For all investors in the RipaEx ICO will be given \euro1,000.00 credit in trading commissions 
in the first Ripa Exchange instance running, while a bonus of \PHP1,000.00 will be given
to all new registered users during the RipaEx ICO to use at your own will.

\section{How to Invest}

\section{Market Overview}
	\subsection{Cryptocurrency Market Size and Technology}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The cryptocurrency market cap has been projected to reach as high as 
			\href{https://www.ccn.com/cryptocurrency-market-cap-to-reach-2-trillion-in-2018-mike-novogratz/}{\$1-2 trillion in 2018}
			\cite{novograzPrediction}.
			\item The market cap of Bitcoin exceeded \href{https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/}{\$70 billion}
			\cite{coinmarketcapHistorical}, 
			with peak trading volumes around \$3 billion per day.
			\item Technology consulting firm CB Insights has identified \href{https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/industries-disrupted-blockchain/}{27 ways} 
			\cite{cbinsights} blockchain can fundamentally change processes as diverse as banking, cybersecurity, voting, and academics.
			\item The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, 
			\href{http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_report_2015.pdf}{10\% of global GDP} \cite{wefTTP} 
			will be stored on blockchain technology.
			\item Most mining pools are located in China, comprising 
			\href{https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/}{more than 70\%} \cite{bitcoinMiningChina}
			of total Bitcoin mining. China manufactures most cryptocurrency mining equipment and leverages the country’s cheap electricity prices.
		\end{itemize}

			\captionof{figure}{Cryptocurrency market capitalization April 2018}
		\end{center}

	\subsection{Types of Cryptocurrencies}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There are \href{https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/}{over 1,000 cryptocurrencies} \cite{coinmarketcapAll} 
			in existence right now (called ``altcoin''); 
			over 600 have market capitalizations of over \$100,000.
			\item While Bitcoin’s price has generally been following upward trend, in early 2018, Bitcoin’s price fell sharply, 
			\href{https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/05/bitcoin-price-drops-below-8000-over-60-billion-wiped-off-cryptocurrencies.html}{dipping below \$8,000} 
			\cite{cnbcBitcoinPriceSurge}
			as news of tougher regulation from China and South Korea surfaced. Bitcoin's price also fell 
			following announcements of \href{http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bitcoin-sec-registration-20180307-story.html}{SEC crackdown} 
			\cite{laTimes}
			on crypto exchanges and after Binance 
			\href{https://www.ft.com/content/58a32050-22aa-11e8-add1-0e8958b189ea}{was reportedly hacked}
			\cite{ftBinanceHack}.
			\item Bitcoin’s market share has fallen from 81\% in June 2016 to 41\% one year later, in June 2017. 
			However, Bitcoin’s price has continued to soar.
			\item In August 2017, Ether’s market capitalization was around \$28 billion. At one point, 
			\href{http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-31/ethereum-forecast-surpass-bitcoin-2018}{commentators} \cite{zeroHedge}
			anticipated that Ether’s market 
			capitalization would surpass that of Bitcoin (the 
			\href{https://www.flippening.watch/}{``flippening''} \cite{flippening}). 
			However, issues with Ethereum technology have since caused its value to decline.
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{CryptoMarketDominance}
			\captionof{figure}{Cryptocurrency market dominance April 2018}
		\end{center}

	\subsection{Investing in Cryptocurrencies}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Supply and demand matters. The rate of increase of the supply of Bitcoin will decrease until the number 
			of Bitcoin reaches 21 million, 
			\href{https://www.coindesk.com/top-10-bitcoin-myths-debunked/}{which is expected to take place in the year 2140}
			\cite{mythsDebunked}. Similarly, 
			the supply of Litecoin will be capped at 
			\href{https://support.xbtce.info/Knowledgebase/Article/View/152/59/about-litecoin}{84 million units}
			\cite{ltcLimits}.
			\item Initial coin offerings are trending right now. This year, former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich raised \$35 
			million from an ICO in 
			\href{https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/brave-ico-35-million-30-seconds-brendan-eich/}{less than 30 seconds}
			\cite{techCrunch}, 
			and Bancor Protocol raised \$153 million in 
			\href{https://www.google.com/search?q=Bancor+Protoco+ico&oq=Bancor+Protocol+ico&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i13k1l2.253.542.0.578.4.3.0.0.0.0.177.320.0j2.2.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..3.1.176.LOjRpj0hKrM}{under three hours}
			\cite{bancorProtocol}.
			\item Blockchain-related projects have raised more than 
			\href{https://www.coindesk.com/1-6-billion-all-time-ico-funding-climbs-as-record-500-million-invested-in-july/}{\$1.6 billion via ICOs} 
			\cite{coindeskICOAllTimeHigh} 
			to date, while venture capitalists have provided only 
			\href{http://my.pitchbook.com/?pbr=14763750}{\$550 million} \cite{pitchbook} for cryptocurrency companies.
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{FundsCollectedICO}
			\captionof{figure}{Funds colleted in ICOs in 2017-2018}
		\end{center}

	\subsection{Outstanding Issues}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Accounting}. While the US has been cracking down on unregulated activities, in countries such as 
			\href{https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/germany-recognizes-bitcoin-as-private-money-sales-tax-coming-soon/}{Germany} 
			\cite{techCrunchPrivateMoney}
			and the \href{http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hmrc-re-classify-bitcoin-private-money-1432718}{UK}
			\cite{ibtimesPrivateMoney}, 
			cryptocurrencies are treated like ``private money'' and are not subject to tax outside of commercial use.
			\item \textbf{Regulation}. New York State created the 
			\href{https://www.wired.com/2014/07/ny_bitcoin/}{BitLicense system} \cite{wiredNYLicense}, mandates for companies 
			before conducting business with New York residents. As of mid-2017, only three BitLicenses have been issued, 
			and a far greater number withdrawn or denied. In Asia, where cryptocurrency demand has been soaring, 
			the \href{http://fortune.com/2018/01/17/china-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-crackdown/}{Chinese} 
			\cite{fortune}
			and \href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/south-korea-seeks-measures-to-curb-frenzied-bitcoin-speculation}{South Korean} 
			\cite{bloombergSKBan}
			governments have taken hard stances on cryptocurrency regulation.
			\item \textbf{Security}. The 
			\href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2016/12/20/hackers-have-stolen-millions-of-dollars-in-bitcoin-using-only-phone-numbers/#3ac0bf1d38ba}{FTC recorded} 
			\cite{forbesBitcoinHacking} 
			an increase in identity fraud complaints of more than 100\% between 2013 and 2016, 
			and Coinbase, the largest US-based exchange, saw account hacking double just between November and December 2016.
		\end{itemize}

\section{Local Market Analysis and 5 Years Projection}
Ripa Exchange on its opening at the beginning of next year and for all the year 2019 is to be expected
to have the following operating numbers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Registered Users: 5,000			%(1,600,000 BitFinex, 40,000 TheRockTrading)
	\item 24/hours Volume: 25 BTC			%(50,000 BTC BitFinex, 100 BTC TheRockTrading)
	\item Monthly Volume: 750 BTC			%(2,000,000 BTC BitFinex, 5,000 BTC TheRockTrading)
\end{itemize}

Given a transaction fee of 0.20\% the revenue for the first year of operation are expected to be in the order of 180 BTC the 
outcome for the years 2 to 5 is expected to be in the rage described in figure \ref{fig:fiveYearsProjection} 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{axis}[
			symbolic x coords={2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023},
			xtick=data,
			ylabel=BTC,
			xlabel=years
		]
			\addplot[ybar,fill=azure(colorwheel)] coordinates {
				(2019, 180)
				(2020, 300)
				(2021, 500)
				(2022, 1000)
				(2023, 2000)
			};
			\addplot+ [
				sharp plot, color=silver, mark=diamond
				] coordinates {
				(2019,180) (2020,300) (2021,500) (2022,1000) (2023,2000)
				};			
		\end{axis}	
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\captionof{figure}{5 years revenue projection}
	\label{fig:fiveYearsProjection}
\end{center}

Depending on the closing value of the RipaEx ICO, the project is to be expected to open N.1 to N.9 others Ripa Exchange in 
the biennium 2019-2020 spreading the use of the Ripa Exchange codebase and the usage of the XPX token associated with the 
Ripa Blockchain making the figure above into account for each single Ripa Exchange installation.

\section{XPX Token Economics}
As explained in section \ref{sec:theRipaBlockchain} the Ripa Blockchain will have its own XPX token (\PHP symbol) that 
will serve the following purposes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to list new cryptocurrencies on Ripa Exchanges
		\item to advertise new projects
		\item to buy RipaEx gadget on RipaEx Store
		\item to pay for the sell of goods \& services on authorized resellers with our RipaEx POS (Point of Sale)
		\item to share liquidity between Ripa Exchanges in the same network
	\end{enumerate}
It is our main purpose that the economy of the XPX token will stay healthy for all the duration of the RipaEx project for 
this reason we will apply economic strategies\footnote{Like burning tokens not covered from ICO funds} 
to the token economy to make the price of the token rise constantly during all the duration of the project and beyond.

\section{Recommendations}
If you are planning to start your own crypto asset marketplace you are invited to follow the following procedure to make
your start-up plan a success in the Ripa ecosystem:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Submit your proposal to Ripa Community Fund by its official website\footnote{Available after March 2019} or by contacting us
	on our official social channels
	\item Get the funds you need from RCF, Venture Capital or ICO
	\item Decide the functional specifications of your exchange
	\item Implement the exchange
	\item Open to public
\end{enumerate}

Following the procedure above you are likely to start a successful exchange for which you own the source code and which will 
generate revenues for your business action in the next 5 years.

It can't be stressed enough that if your intent is to open a FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange you should
focus first on law compliance by studying the AML/KYC laws of the country of incorporation and
finding banking partners to work with. Local financial Authority can help to comply with rules \& regulations and 
local cryptocurrencies foundations can help you to tune your exchanges operations to perform targeted
operations based on the customers interests in the country of incorporation promoting 
cryptocurrency-friendly users in the area of interest.\\

Remember that \textbf{\textsc{running an exchange is hard}} but we'll give you all the tools to start your entrepreneurship venture
with all you need: source code, liquidity and financing will be available to you from day 1 of your trading operations 
so you can focus on giving platinum customer support, law compliance and partnering with financial institutions 
for the success of your entrepreneurship action.

\textsc{Your success is the success of the Ripa exchange network} and we want to achieve that with hard work and the most advanced
technology in the industry for \textsc{YOU} and for the satisfaction of the Ripa network clients.
