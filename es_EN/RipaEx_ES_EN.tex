\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{Ripa Exchange is a hybrid-decentralized exchange with a strong focus on lowering the entry level
of opening new exchanges and giving crypto traders safe and secure trading partners to operate on a daily basis.}\\

The team of RipaEx believes that, despite the recent developments in the world of
cryptocurrencies, it is still expensive to open, manage and build trust on a newly created exchange not
only for the resources need to run a reliable exchange platform but also for the build of the platform 
itself and to find the liquidity necessary to run a profitable business in the first 5 years gap.\\

Action is needed and action is needed now. Users are frustrated with unreliable exchanges that run away
with their funds, got hacked or does not sustain the load of a growing industry of today. Despite
the effort of exchanges managers to offer efficient, reliable, and easy to use platforms to trade entry
prices for building such platforms is in the rage of 250-300 thousand euro and that does not 
include personnel cost to give platinum customer support, platform infrastructure and daily expenses for
the business. All of that for then having an decent exchange platform for which you will need to pay an 
external software company to make changes as you request.\\

It is the aim of this project to give you an Open Source, efficient, reliable exchange platform and to
give the needed liquidity\footnote{Thank you to the RLSP (Ripa Liquidity Service Provider) technology} to your newly created 
exchange from day \textbf{one} so you can focus on finding your customers, give platinum support and comply with all the heterogeneous 
laws in the industry. 
As we want that the customer experience will be the sleekest possible, while making it safer to trade.\\

\section{Roadmap}
There are essentially four phases to the RipaEx project:
\tcbset{roadmapBox/.style={colback=yellow!10!white,colframe=azure(colorwheel),
equal height group=nobefaf,width=(\linewidth-1pt), height from=4cm to 8cm, nobeforeafter,

\begin{center}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[roadmapBox,
		title=\textbf{\textsc{Funding the project: XPX PreSale and RIPA TEC (WP2)}}]

		This phase recognizes the existence of interest in this market development
		from across the World concerning the lowering of the entry level for building a cryptocurrency exchange.
		It aims to make the first comprehensive analysis of this state of the art to form the basis of the later project phases and
		build the first working prototype of a centralized exchange based on Peatio.\\

	\resizebox{0.05\textwidth}{26pt}{$\Downarrow$}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[roadmapBox,
		title=\textbf{\textsc{First exchange opening and development of tools and resources (WP3)}}]

		The second phase takes the results of the first 
		and develops from them a set of tools and resources which provide concise and comprehensible guidance to market actors in any
		Country. With the first instance of Ripa Exchange running we can make first contact with other economical players in the industry.\\

	\resizebox{0.05\textwidth}{26pt}{$\Downarrow$}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[roadmapBox,
		title=\textbf{\textsc{Dissemination (WP 7/8) and Project Coordination (WP1)}}]

		During the full duration of the project, 
		dissemination activities (WP 7/8) are carried out in which results from the individual work packages are disseminated 
		to relevant target groups including project partners, RipaEx investors, exchanges managers, banking partners as well 
		as relevant target groups. This phase covers a wide range of dissemination techniques, from printed and
		electronic handbooks to workshops and training sessions, hackatons, ongoing networks, all having the
		ultimate goal of defining a standard for exchange communication among public and private entities. 
		An overarching work package is concerned with the management of the project from start to finish, 
		ensuring proper coordination, quality assurance and budgetary control (WP1).
	\end{tcolorbox}
	\resizebox{0.05\textwidth}{26pt}{$\Downarrow$}
	\begin{tcolorbox}[roadmapBox,
		title=\textbf{\textsc{Development of hybrid-decentralized exchange (WP 4-6)}}]

		Using the tools and resources developed in WP3, 
		Work packages 4-6 focus on bringing collected knowledge and tools into practice. The three work packages reflect three major
		focal points (and target groups) within the network of exchanges created for establishing successful 
		demonstrations on a local scale: incorporations of local Ripa Exchanges (WP4), technical analysis for the 
		Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (WP5), and first MVP of the hybrid decentralized exchange (WP6). The demonstration
		phase forms the heart of the RipaEx action; WP 2 and 3 are focused on providing
		deliverables (e.g. tools) that enable successful and efficient demonstration activities.\\

	\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

\section{RipaEx Governance}\index{RipaEx Governance}
Creation of a new Ripa Exchange in the Ripa network, release of RCF funds for the creation of new exchanges will be
decided with a majority voting system among all the delegates of the Ripa network. The customization of the individual
exchange instance, otherwise, will be decided exclusively from the company that manages that single exchange
instance.

The RipaEx project will be incorporated as a collective interest company for profit as soon as the Ripa Blockchain
will be stable, instead the company Ripa Exchange Ltd will manage the first individual crypto asset marketplace
instance that will be opened to public in the first quarter of 2019.

\subsection{Features at Launch}
At the first working Ripa Exchange instance opening the following features will be functioning:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsc{CRYPTO $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO}:
	\item \textsc{OAuth}: Facebook, Google, Twitter
	\item \textsc{FIDO}: login with FIDO Alliance standards
	\item \textsc{Protocols}: POW, DPOS, Masternode, tether, ERC20
	\item \textsc{Currencies}: BTC, ETH, DOGE, BCH, TUSD, ARK, LISK, SHIFT, RISE, KAPU, OXY, RIPA, promising ERC20 tokens
	\item \textsc{Main Markets}: BTC, ETH, ARK
	\item \textsc{Orders Type}: market, limit
\end{itemize}

\section{The Ripa Blockchain}
The RipaEx project will have its own blockchain called Ripa which will be run on the DPOS protocol and has the XPX 
token (\PHP symbol) running on it that will serve the five following purposes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to list new cryptocurrencies on Ripa Exchanges
		\item to advertise new projects
		\item to buy RipaEx gadget on the RipaEx Store
		\item to pay for the sell of goods \& services on authorized resellers with our RipaEx POS (Point of Sale)
		\item to share liquidity between Ripa Exchanges in the same network
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Delegated Proof of Stake Technology}
Ripa Blockchain, will inherits the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus system that was first introduced
by BitShares. This consensus algorithm was designed to eliminate the issues associated with Proof of Work (PoW), 
namely the centralization of computing power and the exponentially increasing waste of real world energy. While not
completely decentralized as it relies on consensus by a fixed number of elected delegates, it guarantees a better decentralization 
than Bitcoin. The consensus algorithm implementation is improved over time, evolving into an optimal consensus system.\\

The technical description of the Ripa blockchain is as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 101 active forging Delegates
		\item Delegates selected by vote mechanism built into DPoS
		\item 115,000,000 XPX - Seeded Genesis Block
	\end{itemize}
	\item Multi-signature accounts
	\item Constant block reward
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 2 \PHP per block
		\item Inflation Rate (with 8s block times)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 6.31\% for the first year
			\item 5.93\% the 2nd year
			\item 4.02\% the 10th year
		\end{itemize}
		\item 8-second block time
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Decreased block time possible with future upgrades to the core.
		\end{itemize}
		\item 25 transactions per block
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Increased via soft fork as needed.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Routing tables
	\item SmartBridge data field for custom use and bridging blockchains (ARK Contract Execution Service)
	\item Batch transactions\footnote{Future upgrade: when ARK 2.0 will be released \label{note1}}
	\item Custom transaction fees\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]
	\item Native smart contract execution\footnote{Future upgrade: when ARK Virtual Machine will be released}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Connecting Blockchains}
\subsubsection{ARK Bridged Blockchains (SmartBridge Technology)}
The ARK Platform does not provide direct support for sidechains or dapp databases.
Instead, a mechanism to bridge together blockchains is provided via a bridging
function built into ARK Core where any blockchain can send and receive trigger
function notices and informational data through the primary ARK network via
custom developed \textbf{SmartBridge(s)} and \textbf{Encoded Listeners}.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{ARKSmartBridge}
	\captionof{figure}{ARK SmartBridge Technology}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{A.C.E.S. - ARK Contract Execution Service}
ACES is a blockchain interoperability platform that provides simple protocols and tools for building a robust blockchain 
service marketplace.

ACES is composed mainly of the following three components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Listeners} ACES Listeners provide a way for all the different blockchain transaction events to be easily 
	consumed via a common REST-ful API. The API allows consumers to create subscriptions and receive blockchain events 
	in real-time using Webhook callbacks.
	\item \textbf{Services} ACES Services create and execute Service Contracts, which can be anything from uploading 
	a file to a storage blockchain, performing value transfers, creating smart contracts, executing code on 
	blockchain based computing platforms, or interacting with IoT hardware.
	\item \textbf{Marketplace Console} The ACES Marketplace Console is a consumer dashboard for searching and executing 
	service contracts listed on the Marketplace. ACES Service providers can list their service nodes using the Marketplace API.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{ACES}
	\captionof{figure}{ARK-BTC A.C.E.S. SmartBridge Implementation Overview}
\end{center}

\subsection{Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (R.L.S.P)}
Using the SmartBridge technology RipaEx will build a mechanism to share liquidity between all the exchanges in the Ripa network
by writing the single exchange orderbook in the Ripa Blockchain and by executing order matching between all exchanges in the network.

In this way you can have the benefits of a decentralized orderbook (like liquidity) with the benefits of a centralized exchange (like
platinum customer support and FIAT exchange).

\subsection{Ripa Community Fund}
To permits the birth of new exchanges in the Ripa network a Ripa Community Fund - RCF - is created with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Starting Principal}: the RCF will have a starting operating capital of 5\% (5,750,000 \PHP) of the genesis block
	\item \textbf{Recurring Participation}: each delegate will contribute to the RCF with 5\% of its forged XPXs
\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
To obtain funds from the RCF to start your own Ripa Exchange you will submit your proposal in the official RCF section in the Ripa forum at
anytime after the first Ripa Exchange instance will be operational.

%	CHAPTER 5: Token Sale
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapterimage{chapter_head_4_Dubai.jpg} % Chapter heading image
\chapter{Token Sale}
\section{Introduction}
The RipaEx XPX token sale will be separated into two phases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textsc{PreSale}}: that will run from April to June 2018
		\item \textbf{\textsc{RIPA TEC}}: that will run from July to December 2018
	\end{itemize}
\vspace{5mm}
You can easily refer to both phases PreSale and RIPA TEC as \textit{RipaEx ICO}.

Coins distribution will be available at the end of each trading day and performed automatically through the RIPA TEC platform. Minimum
threshold to reach is 25 BTC.\\

\textsc{As the XPX exchange rate is calculated against the euro currency directly you are guaranteed to not loose any invested fund
during the sale period as the XPX tokens will be listed on our exchanges at the beginning of 2019 directly with the same \textbf{\PHP/\euro0.10}
exchange rate agreed during the token sale-ICO phase}.\\

\section{Local Market Analysis and 5 Years Projection}
Ripa Exchange on its opening at the beginning of next year and for all the year 2019 is to be expected
to have the following operating numbers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Registered Users: 5,000			%(1,600,000 BitFinex, 40,000 TheRockTrading)
	\item 24/hours Volume: 25 BTC			%(50,000 BTC BitFinex, 100 BTC TheRockTrading)
	\item Monthly Volume: 750 BTC			%(2,000,000 BTC BitFinex, 5,000 BTC TheRockTrading)
\end{itemize}

Given a transaction fee of 0.20\% the revenue for the first year of operation are expected to be in the order of 180 BTC the 
outcome for the years 2 to 5 is expected to be in the rage described in figure \ref{fig:fiveYearsProjection} 
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{axis}[
			symbolic x coords={2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023},

			xlabel=years
		]
			\addplot[ybar,fill=azure(colorwheel)] coordinates {
				(2019, 180)
				(2020, 300)
				(2021, 500)
				(2022, 1000)
				(2023, 2000)
			};
			\addplot+ [
				sharp plot, color=silver, mark=diamond
				] coordinates {
				(2019,180) (2020,300) (2021,500) (2022,1000) (2023,2000)
				};			
		\end{axis}	
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\captionof{figure}{5 years revenue projection}
	\label{fig:fiveYearsProjection}
\end{center}

Depending on the closing value of the RipaEx ICO, the project is to be expected to open N.1 to N.9 others Ripa Exchange in 
the biennium 2019-2020 spreading the use of the Ripa Exchange codebase and the usage of the XPX token associated with the 
Ripa Blockchain making the figure above into account for each single Ripa Exchange installation.

\section{XPX Token Economics}
As explained in section \ref{sec:theRipaBlockchain} the Ripa Blockchain will have its own XPX token (\PHP symbol) that 
will serve the following purposes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to list new cryptocurrencies on Ripa Exchanges
		\item to advertise new projects
		\item to buy RipaEx gadget on RipaEx Store
		\item to pay for the sell of goods \& services on authorized resellers with our RipaEx POS (Point of Sale)
		\item to share liquidity between Ripa Exchanges in the same network
	\end{enumerate}
It is our main purpose that the economy of the XPX token will stay healthy for all the duration of the RipaEx project for 
this reason we will apply economic strategies\footnote{Like burning tokens not covered from ICO funds} 
to the token economy to make the price of the token rise constantly during all the duration of the project and beyond.

\section{Recommendations}
If you are planning to start your own crypto asset marketplace you are invited to follow the following procedure to make
your start-up plan a success in the Ripa ecosystem:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Submit your proposal to Ripa Community Fund by its official website\footnote{Available after March 2019} or by contacting us
	on our official social channels
	\item Get the funds you need from RCF, Venture Capital or ICO
	\item Decide the functional specifications of your exchange
	\item Implement the exchange
	\item Open to public
\end{enumerate}

Following the procedure above you are likely to start a successful exchange for which you own the source code and which will 
generate revenues for your business action in the next 5 years.

It can't be stressed enough that if your intent is to open a FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange you should
focus first on law compliance by studying the AML/KYC laws of the country of incorporation and
finding banking partners to work with. Local financial Authority can help to comply with rules \& regulations and 
local cryptocurrencies foundations can help you to tune your exchanges operations to perform targeted
operations based on the customers interests in the country of incorporation promoting 
cryptocurrency-friendly users in the area of interest.\\

Remember that \textbf{\textsc{running an exchange is hard}} but we'll give you all the tools to start your entrepreneurship venture
with all you need: source code, liquidity and financing will be available to you from day 1 of your trading operations 
so you can focus on giving platinum customer support, law compliance and partnering with financial institutions 
for the success of your entrepreneurship action.

\textsc{Your success is the success of the Ripa exchange network} and we want to achieve that with hard work and the most advanced
technology in the industry for \textsc{YOU} and for the satisfaction of the Ripa network clients.
