\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{Ripa Exchange is a hybrid-decentralized exchange with a strong focus on lowering the entry level
of opening new exchanges and giving crypto traders safe and secure trading partners to operate on a daily basis.}\\

The team of Ripa Exchange believes that, despite the recent developments in the world of
cryptocurrencies, it is still expensive to open, manage and build trust on a newly created exchange not
only for the resources need to run a reliable exchange platform but also for the build of the platform 
itself and to find the liqudity necessary to run a profitable business in the first 3-5 year gap.\\

Action is needed and action is needed now. Users are frustrated with unreliable exchanges that run away
with their funds, got hacked or does not sustain the load of a growing industry like this is. Despite
the effort of exchanges managers to offer efficient, reliable, and easy to use platforms to trade entry
prices for building such platforms is in the rage of five-six hundered thousand dollars and that does not 
include personnel cost to give platinum customer support, platform infrastructure and daily expenses for
the business. All of that for then having an decent exchange platform for which you will need to pay an 
external software company to make changes as you request.\\

It is the aim of this project to give you an Open Source, efficient, reliable exchange platform and to
give the needed liquidity\footnote{Thank you to the RLSP (Ripa Liquidity Service Provider) technology} to your newly created 
exchange from day \textbf{one} so you can focus on finding your customers, give platinum support and comply with all the eterogeneus 
laws in the industry. As we want that the customer experience will be the best (the sleekest) as possible while making them safer to trade.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
- The industry of virtual currencies has (a high entry level from a technical point of view for the average user
and) an high entry level from an economical point of view for the average entrepreneur for buying a reliable cryptocurrency 
exchange source code, to hire professional DevOps personnel, to hire customer support operatives, to comply with national and 
international AML/KYC regulations to have liquidity from day one of the exchanges operations. We want to lower this entry level because
\textbf{running an exchange is HARD} and we want you to focus on things that matters not of caveauts that the industry require because
you want to start to make business in this industry and you need the source code to do it.

To strenghten that there is the point that starting an exchange require an high level of investments form your venture capital 
and also with that the profit of your exchanges operations are not guaranteed in the first 5 years timespan.

For building a professional exchange services we think that the source code of your exchange and the liquidity to offer to your clients
from day one should be given to you free of charge: no more paying \$150,000.00 to a company just to have a platform that works and for
which you need to pay another \$100,000.00 - 150,000.00 just to brand it and customize as for your needs so you can tide your 
business to a company that may go bankarupt in the future and found you in trouble as you never had the source code of the product
your business rely on.

\textbf{We believe that all of this should be free} and we should offer you the best technology in the market so you can focus on your business
while we focus on building the technology to run your business in an efficient, secure, responsive and productive way. That is why Ripa Exchange 
is focusing on building a network of exchanges focusing on an exchange architecture that is \textit{efficient, secure, UI responsive, compliant and customizable}
so each exchange in the network can rely on solid foundations while customising its single exchange instance for the needs 
the business entity of that particular exchange installation needs.

For reaching that goal we choosen to build our Ripa Liquidity Service Provider technology on top of ARK - a blockchain for consumer adoption - 
which primary focus is increasing consumer adoption for blockchain technologies focusing on two critical areas: \underline{A Fast Secure Core Technology}
and \underline{Practical Services for Real People}. ARK ecosystem is still at its early stage of development: in current implementation 
there is the possibility to run smart contracts natively on the ARK 2.0 blockchain, this will permits this blockchain tecnology to compete 
with Ethereum from a thecnological point of view.

The Ripa Founder Team (RFT), as presented on ripaex.io, acts in the name of the Ripa Crew. The RFT is responsible for the proper use of 
funds collected under the Token Exchange Campaign (RIPA - TEC) presented below in this document.

The RFT undertakes that the result of this TEC will be used exclusively for the financing of the \emph{Ripa Exchange} project as explained in this 
whitepaper - which will be made available on the collection platform: tec.ripaex.io - and which should result in the creation of a 
legal entity whose name will be \emph{Ripa Exchange}. The creation of this company is scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.

To this end, RFT intervenes on behalf of \emph{Ripa Exchange, a company in the process of being incorporated}.

\section{Roadmap}\index{Roadmap}
There are essentially four phases to the RipaEx project:

\begin{description}
	\item[Funding the project: XPX presale and RIPA TEC (WP2)] This phase recognises the existence of interest in this market development
	from across the World concerning the lowering of the entry level for building a cryptocurrency exchange.
	It aims to make the first comprehensive analysis of this state of the art to form the basis of the later project phases and
	build the first working prototype of a centralized exchange based on Peatio.    
	\item[First exchange opening and development of tools and resources (WP3)] The second phase takes the results of the first 
	and develops from them a set of tools and resources which provide concise and comprehensible guidance to market actors in any
	Country. With the first instance of Ripa Exchange running first contacts with other economical players in the industry can be
	done.
	\item[Development of hybrid-decentralized exchange (WP 4-6)] Using the tools and resources developed in WP3, 
	Work packages 4-6 focus on bringing collected knowledge and tools into practice. The three work packages reflect three major
	focal points (and target groups) within the network of exchange created for establishing successful 
	demonstrations on local scale: incorporations of local Ripa Exchanges (WP4), technical analysis for the 
	Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (WP5), and first MVP of the hybrid decentralized exchange (WP6). The demonstration
    phase forms the heart of the RipaEx action; WP 2 and 3 are focused on providing
    deliverables (e.g. tools) that enable successful and efficient demonstration activities.    
	\item[Dissemination (WP 7/8) and Project Coordination (WP1)] During the full duration of the project, 
	dissemination activities (WP 7/8) are carried out in which results from the individual work packages are disseminated 
	to relevant target groups including project partners, RipaEx supporters, exchanges managers, banking partners as well 
	as relevant target groups. This phase covers a wide range of dissemination techniques, from printed and
    electronic handbooks to workshops and training sessions, ongoing networks, all having the
	ultimate goal of defining a standard for exchanges communication among public and private entities. 
	An overarching work package is concerned with the management of the project from start to finish, ensuring proper coordination, 
	quality assurance and budgetary control (WP1).

\section{Summary}\index{Lists!Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item RipaEx is a project to facilitate the uptake of standards to share liquidity between crypto assets marketplaces. 
	The objective of RipaEx is the promotion of shared source code for wallets and exchanges in the virtual currency industry: 
	It is the aim of this reference document to give in-depth information to prospective exchange developers,
	or exchange managers, to enable correct decision-making and to ensure success for their proposed projects. 
	It seeks to analyse the real potential in the Country of application for a network of cryptocurrency exchanges, 
	and its place in the market.
	\item Crypto assets are an alternative to centralized assets managed by (country-specific) stock exchanges. Although certain
	stock exchanges gives the possibility to their users to verify and manage the assets they own the verification process
	is not always transparent that is the reason because from 2009 \cite{bitcoin} onwards a new types of (community-verifiable) assets 
	have been implemented to give small, medium and big investors complete transparency in the manageing of their investments
	assets.
	\item Recent developments at European Union level and worldwide are transforming both how virtual currencies
	are treated and the way ICO (Initial Coin Offering) are legislated. These combined developments 
	have made the use and production of virtual currencies an increasingly favourable prospect. 
	In May 2013, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the XXXX Directive requires that Member States in 2013
	to threat cryptographic secure assets to be threated as a virtual currencies addin, in Directve XXXX,
	that the trade of this asset should be exempt from VATs. The EU that in Directive XXXX legislated 
	about the exchange and AML/KYC procedures to undergo in those business regulations.
	\item There is still very little regulation performed on ICOs and virtual currencies. Combining total 
	crypto secured assets marcket capitalization is 500 B USD and is predicted to grow to 5.000 B USD in the next ten years span.

	\item The results indicate that medium tech savy from 18 to 45 is the average user of
	virtual currencies although the corporate finance companies are also starting to put 
	virtual currencies schemes insied their portfolio especially since the presentation 
	of the bitcoin ETF fund in the stock exchange of XXXX (Chicago) last 17th of December 2018.

	\item Total virtual currencies market capitalization has been estimated around 500 B USD
	and is predicted to grow to 5,000.00 B USD in the next ten years span.

	\item Local authorities are working with National Governments to make sure local exchangers
	in the national territory are complying with national and international AML/KYC regulations.
	Venture capitals and Angel Investors are starting to release financing solutions to start-ups 
	in the Fintech industry all over the world from America to Asia passing through Europe and some 
	Countries are starting state-owned cryptocurrencies schemes to test the exchange of goods \& services
	on those (distributed ledger) technologies.

	\item Costs	
	- The average cost of 23.4 %€cpl 
	was estimated for the cost of UCO collection. Costs for a
	collection will very much depend on UCO generator ie domestic or catering or industry,
	and the particulars of your locality. Some research suggests that the actual operating
	costs could be as low as 8 %€cpl 
	to collect UCO from catering establishments if collection is
	kept “in-house”. The viability of a biodiesel plant will depend very heavily on the price for
	which it can obtain its raw material. The ideal scenario would be to be able to operate a
	free collection service.

	\item Problems: banking partners and comply with rules \& regulations
	- The main problems encountered in UCO collection schemes were: Pouring of mineral oil
	in public containers; Low temperatures creating handling problems; Overcooking of oil which 
	increase Free Fatty Acids (FFAs); Too much saturated fats; Illegal collections.

	\item how exchange works
	- Classic industrial steps to biodiesel production are: 1. Oil pre-treatment 2. Free Fatty
	Acids elimination 3. Drying 4. Transesterification in reactors 5. Separation phase 6.
	Washing 7. Drying. Glycerine purification 8. Additive injection.

	\item choice for an exchange
	- Choice of the fats or oils to be used in producing biodiesel is both a process chemistry
	decision and an economic decision. With respect to process chemistry, the greatest
	difference among the choices of fats and oils is the amount of FFAs.

	\item Raw Material
	- Options for raw material are: Primary biomass (energy crops); secondary biomass and
	organic waste. Process catalyst options are: Alkaline catalysis; Acid catalysts;
	Heterogeneous catalysis; Enzymatic catalysis; No catalysts (Biox Co-Solvent Process \&
	supercritical process). Process options are: Batch or Continuous. Batch processing is
	most common in small plants of less than 4 million litres/year.

	\item Setting up an exchange: funding, compliance, banking partners
	- For setting-up a biodiesel plant a project must take into account the following leglislation:
	Health \& Safety; Oil Storage; Fire prevention and control; Integrated Pollution Prevention
	and Control (IPPC); Planning; Taxation. By far the biggest and most arduous task with
	regards to legitimising the biodiesel plant is obtaining an Integrated Pollution Prevention
	and Control (IPPC) licence. The IPPC follows Council Directive 96/61/EC and is applied
	in each country via its own national laws. Costs of an IPPC licence can vary between
	%€ 
	3000 and %€
	35,000, depending on the size of operation.

	\item Staff needed for running an exchange. Resources needed to run an exchange
	- The nature of the business under consideration by the BioDieNet project (small scale,
	localised biodiesel production), means that each enterprise likely to have 3 or 4 staff. The
	turnover of such an enterprise however, because of the high value of the end product, is
	likely to be more than %€
	350,000 a year and could be several times higher. A business of
	this scale lends itself to the following possible company structures: A simple partnership;
	A limited company; A non-profit company or social enterprise; A worker co-operative.
	Energy Agencies are potential key actors, but the type of business they can set up will
	depend on their legal status which does vary from country to country.

	\item Sources of funds for exchanges: venture capitals, angel investors, (traditional) banking,
	(innovative banking) ICO
	- Potential sources of funds for a small-scale biodiesel projects are: Bank Loans; Low
	Interest Loan Schemes; Commercial Credit; Equity financing; Business Angels venture
	capital. Having a robust Business Plan and financial guarantees are essential elements
	for securing funding. The European Investment Fund (EIF) of the EIB, offers support in
	the form of guarantees for SMEs.

	\item Arguments to go into that field
	- The arguments for biodiesel are principally for Energy Security and Climate Change.
	There are other benefits, well documented, such as improvements in most local
	emissions, its reduced environmental impacts in case of spillage, job creation etc. But
	above all, biofuels are the only direct substitute for oil in transport that is currently
	available on a significant scale.

	\item There is consensus
	- There is consensus in the literature that the use of biodiesel in place of petroleum diesel
	will result in significant GHG savings, with the potential for up to 80\% from oil crops. The
	GHG savings potential of a scheme recycling UCO into biodiesel could be near on 100\%.

	\item Benefits of virtual currencies schemes
	- Statistical analyses show a reduction of the local emissions of CO, HC, and PM10 by an
	average of 27\%,36\%,24\% respectively for neat biodiesel relative to petroleum diesel. It is
	also predicted that up to around 30\% that biodiesel will be NOx neutral although after that
	will increase. Hence any responsible environmental strategy would include a NOx
	mitigation policy. There is agreement that the use of biodiesel results in both a decrease
	in emissions of PAH, and in mutagenic activity.

	\item Physical process of securing assets on the blockchains
	- Heated fuel lines are recommended for cold weather as B100 has higher cloud point than
	fossil diesel. Rubber components should be replace with biodiesel resistant parts and
	similarly biodiesel should not be brought into contact with brass, bronze, copper, lead, tin,
	and zinc as this may accelerate oxidation. Normally if warranty is approved for 100%
	biodiesel this will be provided that the standard engine oil change interval is halved, and
	similarly the oil and fuel filter change interval is halved.

	\item Banking resistance 
	- The two cricitcal factors affecting the biodiesel market are taxation and the warranty
	approval for the vehicles. Although a harmonisation throughout Europe would be
	beneficial to development of the industry both in terms of taxation and warranty
	approvals, this is currently not the case. Each country has its specific legislation and tax
	regime for all fuels, including biofuels, and vehicle manufacturers vary their warranty
	approval between countries.

	\item Korea-China-Japan leads for transactions, 
	- Germany, has been the leader in the field of biodiesel for over 10 years, with a proactive
	approach and favourable tax regime. At the end of 2006, total sales of biofuels were 3.1
	million tonnes (all biofuels). But Volkswagen Group (VW, Audi, SEAT, Skoda) has
	stopped issuing warranty approval since the introduction of the EURO 4 engines and selfregenerating
	particle filters. This could seriously damage the market and reverse the
	trend.

	\item Any assessment of your local market should include: numer of potential users to reach, 
	type of exchange to incorporate (FIAT <-> CRYTPO or CRYPTO <-> CRYPTO), type of crypto to imtegrate
	(POW, DPOS, Masternodes, others...), types of services to offer (exchange only, advanced trading tools,
	payment processor, others...), if FIAT <-> CRYPTO exchange number of FIAT payments processors to accept,
	number of others exchanges in your region.
	- Number of diesel vehicles in your
	region; Quantity of diesel consumed in your region; Quantity of biodiesel already
	consumed in your region; Local government fleets composition and fuel usage; Local
	public transport fleets composition and fuel usage; Number of independent filling stations
	in your region.

	\item Customer protection
	- There are a number of options for dealing with Warranty issues: Creating consumer
	pressure by making clear to the manufacturers that providing warranties for biodiesel will
	be an important factor in decision-making for purchase of new vehicles; Undertaking a
	liability transfer where the risk is shifted onto the local authority or other public body;
	Development of your own warranty; Or simply promoting biodiesel for the vehicle pool
	that is out of warranty.

	\item Examples of customer protections
	- Favourable warranties are found with the following: Mercedes Benz, DaimlerChrysler,
	MAN and IVECO who have given approvals for EURO-4 and EURO-5 truck engines in
	commercial vehicles; Almost all agricultural vehicle manufacturers; The French
	manufacturers PSA Peugeot Citroën and Renault approve warranties for their vehicles up
	to B30 under certain conditions. This offers sales prospects of at least 10 years. The
	public sector, whether it be bus fleets or waste collection vehicles is likely to be “path of
	least resistance” for biodiesel sales.

	\item Recommendations for all/for law compliance: 
	- Local Authority and Energy Agency to participate in biodiesel
	projects; Closing of the loop by uniting the supply chain; Development of a UCO policy to
	make catering waste the responsibility of local authorities; In-depth EU-wide studies on
	UCO availability undertaken by official bodies; A fast-track system for IPPC applications
	for biodiesel plants; Widening of the scope of potential feedstocks in the quality standard
	EN14214; Development of an EU-wide quality assurance scheme; Making it compulsory
	that all EC Euro emissions standards be met using biofuels as well as fossil diesel;
	Promote biodiesel-friendly manufacturers such as PSA group.
