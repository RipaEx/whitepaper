\section{Recommendations}
If you are planning to start your own crypto asset marketplace you are invited to follow the following procedure to make
your start-up plan a success in the Ripa ecosystem:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Submit your proposal to Ripa Community Fund by its official website\footnote{Available after March 2019} or by contacting us
	on our official social channels
	\item Get the funds you need from RCF, Venture Capital or ICO
	\item Decide the functional specifications of your exchange
	\item Implement the exchange
	\item Open to public
\end{enumerate}

Following the procedure above you are likely to start a successful exchange for which you own the source code and which will 
generate revenues for your business action in the next 5 years.

It can't be stressed enough that if your intent is to open a FIAT $\Leftrightarrow$ CRYPTO exchange you should
focus first on law compliance by studying the AML/KYC laws of the country of incorporation and
finding banking partners to work with. Local financial Authority can help to comply with rules \& regulations and 
local cryptocurrencies foundations can help you to tune your exchanges operations to perform targeted
operations based on the customers interests in the country of incorporation promoting 
cryptocurrency-friendly users in the area of interest.\\

Remember that \textbf{\textsc{running an exchange is hard}} but we'll give you all the tools to start your entrepreneurship venture
with all you need: source code, liquidity and financing will be available to you from day 1 of your trading operations 
so you can focus on giving platinum customer support, law compliance and partnering with financial institutions 
for the success of your entrepreneurship action.

\textsc{Your success is the success of the Ripa exchange network} and we want to achieve that with hard work and the most advanced
technology in the industry for \textsc{YOU} and for the satisfaction of the Ripa network clients.
