\chapter{The Ripa Exchange}
Ripa Exchange is an crypto asset (fiat money or cryptocurrency or something) marketplace, following the latest 
industry standards and resting in the principles of ``\textit{open source, secure and efficient}''. Ripa Exchange
aims to serve a platform for crypto-currency enthusiasts by providing a safe, secure, UI responsive, customizable 
and easy to use exchange that embraces open source principles and public trust.\\\\
Ripa Exchange is implemented with the Rails framework and other cutting-edge technology and will be migrated to an
hybrid-decentralized exchange where all exchanges in the Ripa network will share liquidity thanks to RLSP technology.

\section{Towards a Decentralized Exchange...}
Ripa Exchange is a centralized exchange which will be converted into an hybrid-decentralized exchange to create a network of exchanges
that share the same liquidity between each of them so you can offer liquidity from day 1 of your exchanges operations.\\

To offer the PROs of a centralized exchange like platinum customer support and FIAT exchange, with all the PROs of a 
decentralized exchange like liquidity, without the CONs of both of them, 
we need to perform an intermediate step where Ripa Exchange will be converted into an hybrid-decentralized exchange 
and during phase 3 of our project (WP4-6) we will make all the functional and technical analysis required 
to make the next step on solid ground and offer to the RipaEx community an open source, secure and efficient exchange.
