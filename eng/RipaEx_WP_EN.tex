\chapter{Abstract}
\textbf{Ripa Exchange is a hybrid-decentralized exchange with a strong focus on lowering the entry level
of opening new exchanges and giving crypto traders safe and secure trading partners to operate on a daily basis.}\\

The team of Ripa Exchange believes that, despite the recent developments in the world of
cryptocurrencies, it is still expensive to open, manage and build trust on a newly created exchange not
only for the resources need to run a reliable exchange platform but also for the build of the platform 
itself and to find the liquidity necessary to run a profitable business in the first 3-5 year gap.\\

Action is needed and action is needed now. Users are frustrated with unreliable exchanges that run away
with their funds, got hacked or does not sustain the load of a growing industry like this is. Despite
the effort of exchanges managers to offer efficient, reliable, and easy to use platforms to trade entry
prices for building such platforms is in the rage of five-six hundred thousand dollars and that does not 
include personnel cost to give platinum customer support, platform infrastructure and daily expenses for
the business. All of that for then having an decent exchange platform for which you will need to pay an 
external software company to make changes as you request.\\

It is the aim of this project to give you an Open Source, efficient, reliable exchange platform and to
give the needed liquidity\footnote{Thank you to the RLSP (Ripa Liquidity Service Provider) technology} to your newly created 
exchange from day \textbf{one} so you can focus on finding your customers, give platinum support and comply with all the heterogeneous 
laws in the industry. As we want that the customer experience will be the best (the sleekest) as possible while making them safer to trade.\\

\chapter{Introduction}
- The industry of virtual currencies has (a high entry level from a technical point of view for the average user
and) an high entry level from an economical point of view for the average entrepreneur for buying a reliable cryptocurrency 
exchange source code, to hire professional DevOps personnel, to hire customer support operatives, to comply with national and 
international AML/KYC regulations to have liquidity from day one of the exchanges operations. We want to lower this entry level because
\textbf{running an exchange is HARD} and we want you to focus on things that matters not of caveats that the industry require because
you want to start to make business in this industry and you need the source code to do it.

To strengthen that there is the point that starting an exchange require an high level of investments form your venture capital 
and also with that the profit of your exchanges operations are not guaranteed in the first 5 years timespan.

For building a professional exchange services we think that the source code of your exchange and the liquidity to offer to your clients
from day one should be given to you free of charge: no more paying \$150,000.00 to a company just to have a platform that works and for
which you need to pay another \$100,000.00 - 150,000.00 just to brand it and customize as for your needs so you can tide your 
business to a company that may go bankrupt in the future and found you in trouble as you never had the source code of the product
your business rely on.

\textbf{We believe that all of this should be free} and we should offer you the best technology in the market so you can focus on your business
while we focus on building the technology to run your business in an efficient, secure, responsive and productive way. That is why Ripa Exchange 
is focusing on building a network of exchanges focusing on an exchange architecture that is \textit{efficient, secure, UI responsive, compliant and customizable}
so each exchange in the network can rely on solid foundations while customising its single exchange instance for the needs 
the business entity of that particular exchange installation needs is easy to you/accessible to you.

For reaching that goal we chosen to build our Ripa Liquidity Service Provider technology on top of ARK - a blockchain for consumer adoption - 
which primary focus is increasing consumer adoption for blockchain technologies focusing on two critical areas: \underline{A Fast Secure Core Technology}
and \underline{Practical Services for Real People}. ARK ecosystem is still at its early stage of development: in current implementation 
there is the possibility to run smart contracts natively on the ARK 2.0 blockchain, this will permits this blockchain technology to compete 
with Ethereum from a technological point of view. RLSP will permits to share the same liquidity-orderbook to each exchange in the Ripa Network based on
single exchange installation privacy rules, preferences in the admin area of your single exchange instance.

The Ripa Founder Team (RFT), as presented on ripaex.io, acts in the name of the Ripa Crew. The RFT is responsible for the proper use of 
funds collected under the Token Exchange Campaign (RIPA - TEC) presented below in this document.

The RFT undertakes that the result of this TEC will be used exclusively for the financing of the \emph{Ripa Exchange} project as explained in this 
whitepaper - which will be made available on the collection platform: tec.ripaex.io - and which should result in the creation of a 
legal entity whose name will be \emph{Ripa Exchange}. The creation of this company is scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.

To this end, RFT intervenes on behalf of \emph{Ripa Exchange, a company in the process of being incorporated}.

	to relevant target groups including project partners, RipaEx supporters, exchanges managers, banking partners as well 
	as relevant target groups. This phase covers a wide range of dissemination techniques, from printed and
    electronic handbooks to workshops and training sessions, ongoing networks, all having the
	ultimate goal of defining a standard for exchanges communication among public and private entities. 
	An overarching work package is concerned with the management of the project from start to finish, ensuring proper coordination, 
	quality assurance and budgetary control (WP1).
\end{tcolorbox}

\resizebox{0.05\textwidth}{26pt}{$\Downarrow$}

\begin{tcolorbox}[roadmapBox,

	Using the tools and resources developed in WP3, 
	Work packages 4-6 focus on bringing collected knowledge and tools into practice. The three work packages reflect three major
	focal points (and target groups) within the network of exchange created for establishing successful 
	demonstrations on local scale: incorporations of local Ripa Exchanges (WP4), technical analysis for the 
	Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (WP5), and first MVP of the hybrid decentralized exchange (WP6). The demonstration
    phase forms the heart of the RipaEx action; WP 2 and 3 are focused on providing
	deliverables (e.g. tools) that enable successful and efficient demonstration activities.\\

\section{RipaEx Partners - RipaEx Governance}\index{RipaEx Partners - RipaEx Governance}
Most of the partners are entrepreneurs in the virtual currency industry, but a research institute 
and Financial Organizations are also represented. The Partners are:
\begin{description}
	\item[Coordinator]: Ripa Exchanges Ltd
	\item[CoBeneficiaries]: 
\end{description}
\subsection{RipaEx Governance}\index{RipaEx Governance}
Governance for the network of exchanges created, development of the source code, owning of the XPX tokens, Ripa Foundation.

\section{Project Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textsc{what}: RipaEx is a project to facilitate the uptake of standards to share liquidity between crypto assets marketplaces. 
	The objective of RipaEx is the promotion of shared source code for wallets and exchanges in the virtual currency industry: 
	It is the aim of this reference document to give in-depth information to prospective exchange developers,
	or exchange managers, to enable correct decision-making and to ensure success for their proposed projects. 
	It seeks to analyse the real potential in the Country of application for a network of cryptocurrency exchanges, 
	and its place in the market.
	\item \textsc{what}: Crypto assets are an alternative to centralized assets managed by (country-specific) stock exchanges. Although certain
	stock exchanges gives the possibility to their users to verify and manage the assets they own the verification process
	is not always transparent that is the reason because from 2009 \cite{bitcoin} onwards a new types of (community-verifiable) assets 
	have been implemented to give small, medium and big investors complete transparency in the managing of their investments
	assets.
	\item \textsc{when}: Recent developments at European Union level and worldwide are transforming both how virtual currencies
	are treated and the way ICO (Initial Coin Offering) are legislated. These combined developments 
	have made the use and production of virtual currencies an increasingly favourable prospect. \\
	In October 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are exempt from VAT taxation. \\
	In July 2016 the European Commission adopted proposals for legislation to amend the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) that
	will bring virtual currencies exchanged and wallet providers into the EU's anti-money laundering framework \cite{EUAMLCrypto}.\\
	In February 2018 the European Commission launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum \cite{EUBOaF} to highlight key developments 
	of the blockchain technology, promote European actors and reinforce European engagement with multiple stakeholders involved in blockchain activities.
	\item \textsc{why}: However there is still very little regulation performed on ICOs and only United States of America at the moment has undergone
	a legislation defining ICO tokens as securities. \cite{SECICO}
	\item \textsc{who}: The results indicate that medium tech savvy from 18 to 45 is the average user of
	virtual currencies although the corporate finance companies are also starting to put 
	virtual currencies schemes inside their portfolio especially since the presentation 
	of the bitcoin futures contract from CME Group Inc. in the stock exchange of Chicago
	last 18th of December 2017.
	\item \textsc{how much}: Total virtual currencies market capitalization has been estimated around 317 B USD\footnote{Coinmarketcap data April 2018}
	and is predicted to grow to 5,000.00 B USD in the next ten years span \cite{cryptoMCTenYears}.
	\item \textsc{where}: Local authorities are working with National Governments to make sure local exchangers
	in the national territory are complying with national and international AML/KYC regulations.
	Venture capitals and Angel Investors are starting to release financing solutions to start-ups 
	in the Fintech industry all over the world from America to Asia passing through Europe and some 
	Countries are starting state-owned cryptocurrencies schemes to test the exchange of goods \& services
	on those (distributed ledger) technologies \cite{petro}.
	\item \textsc{how much}: The average cost for starting your own crypto asses marketplace is around \$ 150,000.00 only for a running instance of your exchange platform:
	to that you need to add costs to customize the platform before launch and in the future, advertising your new business, running costs for servers,
	network operators, support center operators and legal department to comply with your State of incorporation AML/KYC legislations and general company laws.\\
	\textbf{That is the reason because we think owning the source code of your exchange software is the best way to run a business in this industry}.
	\item \textsc{how}: The main problems encountered in opening a FIAT <-> CRYPTO marketplace is to find trusted
	banking partners to comply with the many different AML/KYC rule and procedures to exchange virtual currencies
	to FIAT currencies.
	\item \textsc{what}: Classical types of exchanges operations are: 
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{one-way exchanges}: in which a centralized application has all the liquidity to offer to its potential users
			\item \textbf{two-way exchanges}: in which a centralized or decentralized platform match the selling requests with the buying requests
			of its users
		\end{enumerate}
		On this a sub-classification is also necessary:
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{FIAT <-> CRYPTO exchanges}: in which exchanges operations are performed between FIAT\footnote{Traditional central banks owned currencies like EUR, USD, GBP, JPY, others...} 
			currencies and virtual currencies
			\item \textbf{CRYPTO <-> CRYPTO exchanges}: in which exchanges operations are performed only between virtual currencies
		\end{enumerate}
	You can build a matrix based on the four configurations above to build the exchange operation platform of your needs.
	\item \textsc{with what}: The specifications to look when choosing for an exchange platform to run are:
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{code}: Open Source, Closed Source or hybrid solution
			\item \textbf{modularization}: separation between exchange engine (orders matching engine), UI and user registry
			\item \textbf{UI responsiveness}
			\item \textbf{compliance} with current industry standards
			\item \textbf{customization} of the exchange engine, trading currencies, UI and other aspects of the crypto asset marketplace platform...
			\item \textbf{security} of the funds: saving in cold wallets and hot wallets configurable
			\item \textbf{transparency} of the funds: proof of solvency of the exchange
			\item \textbf{Multi-Accounts trading}: easy to configure new virtual currency protocols
			\item \textbf{Multi-Accounts users}: possibility to interact with user accounts from Google, Facebook, Twitter 
			to login into the platform and FIDO Alliance security standards for personal credentials.
		\end{enumerate}	
	\textbf{Those are not only technical decisions to be made but also economical} especially the owning of the source code of your crypto asset
	marketplace platform is fundamental to make future customization of your exchange in an independent way compared to rely on a single
	software house that makes the customizations for you.
	\item \textsc{how}: Options for finding users for your exchanges operations are: targeted marketing campaigns, innovative features in the industry,
	fee level based on trading quantities, bonuses for first registration and trading quantities, affiliate marketing for paying users to take their friends
	to your exchange.
	\item \textsc{how}: For setting-up a crypto asset marketplace a project must take into account the following legislation:
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{AML/KYC}: \textit{Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive} if business set up in the European Union \cite{4AMLD} or the AML/KYC reference implementation
			to your crypto asset marketplace Country of incorporation (as an example \textit{Intelligence Reform \& Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004}
			written by FinCEN in the United States of America).\\
			International recommendations for undergoing AML/CFT verifications are given by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering \cite{FATF}.
			\item \textbf{Payment Licence}: By far the biggest and most arduous task with regards to legitimising the 
			FIAT <-> CRYPTO exchanges operations is obtaining a \textit{PSD Licence} \cite{PSD}. 
			The PSD licence follows Council Directive 2007/64/EC and is applied in each country via its own national laws. 
			Costs of an IPPC licence can vary between \euro XXXX and \euro XXXX, depending on the size of operation.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textsc{who}: The nature of the business under consideration by the Ripa Exchange project (small scale,
	localised FIAT <-> CRYPTO exchanges operations), means that each enterprise likely to have 7 or 8 staff: N.2 developers, 
	N.1 network/security operator, N.1 administrative, N.2 client support operators, N.1 legal and tax advisor. \\
	The turnover of such an enterprise however, because of the high value of the end product, is likely to be more than 
	\euro 350,000 a year and could be several times higher. A business of
	this scale lends itself to the following possible company structures: A simple partnership;
	A limited company; A non-profit company or social enterprise; A worker co-operative.
	Financial Agencies are potential key actors, but the type of business they can set up will
	depend on their legal status which does vary from country to country.
	\item \textsc{how}: Potential sources of funds for a small-medium sized crypto asset marketplaces are: Bank Loans; Low
	Interest Loan Schemes; Commercial Credit; Equity financing; Business Angels venture
	capital. Having a robust Business Plan and financial guarantees are essential elements
	for securing funding. The European Investment Fund (EIF) of the EIB, offers support in
	the form of guarantees for SMEs.
	\item \textsc{why}: The arguments for crypto asset marketplaces are for financial freedom, decentralizing of the value-transferring operations, and
	owning for real your money. 
	There are other benefits, well documented, such as faster payments, long term gain based on deflationary economy and prediction of 
	Great Depressions like the one that hit the global economy in 2008. But
	above all, virtual currencies are the only direct competitor to centralized value-transferring operations done by central banks.

	\item \textsc{why}: There is consensus in the literature that the use of virtual currencies in place of fiat currencies will result in 
	higher financial freedom especially as they fit into the Austrian school of economy \cite{austrianTheory} 
	(TODO: add more on Austrian economics school)

	\item \textsc{why}: Benefits of virtual currencies schemes (TODO: put some numbers)

	\item \textsc{how}: Securing assets on the blockchains means basically performing three operations
		\begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
			\item \textbf{Generating a random private key}
			\item \textbf{Converting the private key generated in (1) into a public key}: a common protocol making this conversion
			in the virtual currencies industry is the ECDSA curve algorithm
			\item \textbf{Converting the public key generated in (2) into a virtual currency address}: common protocols for making this conversion
			are hash functions SHA-256, Base58 encoding, Base32 encoding
		\end{enumerate}
	At this point any value sent to the virtual currency address generated in (3) is secured on the blockchain of choice and accessible
	only from the owner of the relative private key generated in (1).
	\item \textsc{where}: The two critical factors affecting the cryptocurrency industry are banks concurrence and State banning.
	Although a harmonisation throughout Europe would be beneficial to development of the industry both in terms of 
	taxation and warranty approvals, this is currently not the case. Each country has its specific legislation and tax
	regime for all exchanges operations involving FIAT money, and State banning is going to completely liberalization 
	of this activities like European Union to complete banning and imprisonment of operators in this industry like Bangladesh
	\cite{bitcoinLegality}. 

	\item \textsc{where}: The Asiatic countries of South Korea, China and Japan are the leader in the field of cryptocurrencies for number of 
	transactions for over 9 years with a proactive approach and favourable tax regime. At the beginning of 2017 in Japan bitcoin
	has been declared legal tender but China has recently declared illegal token sale and exchanges and local cryptocurrencies
	marketplaces are closing down.
	\item \textsc{where}: Any assessment of your local market should include: number of potential users to reach, 
	type of exchange to incorporate (FIAT <-> CRYTPO or CRYPTO <-> CRYPTO), type of virtual currencies protocol 
	to integrate (POW, DPOS, Masternodes, others...), types of services to offer (exchange only, advanced trading tools,
	payment processor, others...), if FIAT <-> CRYPTO exchange number of FIAT payments processors to accept (PayPal, OKPay,
	MoneyPolo, others...), number of others exchanges in your region.

	\item \textsc{who}: there are a number of options for dealing with Warranty/Customer protection issues: 
	creating consumer pressure by making clear to the end users that the possession of the private keys of their
	virtual currency addresses make \textbf{liable} for any loss of the private keys meaning nobody can help
	them recovering their funds if the their private keys are lost. Creating consumer pressure to not leave funds
	on exchanges ("\textit{Be Your own Bank!!}"), making them choose the licensed exchanges in the market. 
	\item \textsc{who}: While it is very expensive to insure money exchanges operations and money transmitting operations, 
	examples of customer protections in the industry are: Kraken platform which is offering Mt. Gox users partial refund
	of their lost, NEO community giving refund to the users involved in the BitGrail hacking, Ethereum supporters
	giving The DAO investors partial refunds, other hacking cases...

	\item \textsc{Recommendations for all/law compliance}: if you intend to incorporate a FIAT <-> CRYPTO exchange you should
	focus from the first instance on law compliance by studying the AML/KYC laws of the country of incorporation and
	finding bank partners to work with. Local financial Authority can help to comply with rules \& regulations and 
	local cryptocurrencies foundations can help you to tune your exchanges operations to perform targeted
	operations based on the customers interests in the country of incorporation.
	Promote cryptocurrency-friendly users in the area of interest.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Towards a Decentralized Exchange...}
Ripa Exchange is a centralized exchange which will be converted into an hybrid-decentralized exchange to create a network of exchanges
that share the same liquidity between each of them so you can offer liquidity from day 1 of your exchanges operations.\\

To offer the PROs of a centralized exchange with all the PROs of a decentralized exchange without the CONs of both of them, 
we need to convert first into an hybrid-decentralized exchange and during phase 3 of our project (WP4-6) we will make all the 
functional and technical analysis required to make the next step on solid ground.

%	CHAPTER 4: Ripa Blockchain
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapterimage{chapter_head_4_Dubai.jpg} % Chapter heading image
\chapter{The Ripa Blockchain}
The project RipaEx will have its own blockchain called Ripa which will be run on the DPOS protocol and has the \PHP 
token (XPX symbol) running on it that will serve the five following purposes:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item to list new cryptocurrencies on Ripa Exchanges
		\item to advertise new projects
		\item to buy RipaEx gadget on Ripa Exchange Store
		\item to pay for the sell of goods \& services on authorized resellers with our RipaEx POS (Point of Sale)
		\item to share liquidity between Ripa Exchanges in the same network
	\end{enumerate}

Ripa \PHP or XPX is a cryptocurrency derivate from ARK, Lisk, Crypti and BitShares with unique differences and improvements
for reaching the goal of shared liquidity between exchanges in the same Ripa network. This code however inherits the 
simplified interactions between ARK and other blockchain systems using DPoS as their consensus. This homogeneous codebase
allows for the potential to provide service bridges in the form of ARK-Lisk blockchain apps, along with any other additional 
systems provided by their blockchain administrators.

\vspace{5mm}
\textsc{\textbf{Ripa blockchain is an ARK fork and the use of a blockchain technology for the network of exchanges created will complete
the ripa ecosystem by permitting each exchange in the ripa network to share the same liquidity. We will always entrust ARK as our 
blockchain technology provider to merge their code into our latest features for what concerning the RIPA Blockchain}}

\vspace{5mm}

Explained the use of the Ripa Blockchain in the RipaEx ecosystem and explained the RIPA - ARK technological relations what is 
following are the specifications of the Ripa Blockchain derived/inherited from ARK.

\section{Delegated Proof of Stake Technology}
Ripa Blockchain, will inherits the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus system that was first introduced
by BitShares. This consensus algorithm was designed to eliminate the issues associated with Proof of Work (PoW), 
namely the centralization of computing power and the exponentially increasing waste of real world energy. While not
completely decentralized as it relies on consensus by a fixed number of elected delegates, it guarantees a better decentralization 
than Bitcoin. The consensus algorithm implementation is improved over time, evolving into an optimal consensus system.\\

The technical description of the Ripa blockchain is as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake)
	\begin{description}
		\item - 101 active forging Delegates
		\item - Delegates selected by vote mechanism built into DPoS
		\item - 115,000,000 RIPA - Seeded Genesis Block
	\end{description}
	\item Multi-signature accounts
	\item Constant block reward
	\begin{description}
		\item - 2 \PHP per block
		\item - Inflation Rate (with 8s block times)
		\begin{description}
			\item 6.31\% for the first year
			\item 5.93\% the 2nd year
			\item 4.02\% the 10th year
		\end{description}
		\item - 8-second block time
		\begin{description}
			\item - Decreased block time possible with future upgrades to the core.
		\end{description}
		\item - 25 transactions per block
		\begin{description}
			\item - Increased via soft fork as needed.
		\end{description}
	\end{description}
	\item Routing tables
	\item SmartBridge data field for custom use and bridging blockchains (ARK Contract Execution Service)
	\item Batch transactions\footnote{Future upgrade: when ARK 2.0 will be released \label{note1}}
	\item Custom transaction fees\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]
	\item Native smart contract execution\footnote{Future upgrade: when ARK Virtual Machine will be released}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5mm}
\textsc{\textbf{As said Ripa blockchain is an ARK fork and we will entrust ARK as our blockchain technology provider to merge their 
code into our latest features for what concerning the RIPA Blockchain}}, features like:
\begin{description}
	\item[Scaling network] up to the level of major Credit Card networks with core upgrades
	\begin{description}
		\item - Increasing the number of Forging Delegates
		\item - Increasing the Block Size to include more transactions
		\item - Implementation of pre-approval PBFT block concept testnet [codename:
		TwinChain]
		\item - Routing tables, to minimize hops among nodes when blocks are broadcast
		\item - Include forging with RIPA Uncles.	
	\end{description}
	\item[Two node types] is used to secure the RIPA network:
	\begin{description}
		\item[Relay nodes] - Nodes with full API functionality, acting as a backend for the
		feature rich lite clients. Relay nodes do not collect any transaction fee and do
		not have the ability to Forge RIPA Blocks.
		\item[Forging nodes] - Nodes with reduced API functionality, decreasing the
		exposure to potential DDoS attacks on the RIPA Platform. Forging nodes are
		able to Forge RIPA and receive transaction fees.
	\end{description}
	\item[Official lite client] for network access is be provided shortly before the mainnet
	launch including desktop clients (Windows, MacOS, and Linux) and mobile clients
	(Android and iOS).
	\item[OffLine wallet creation]: the network itself does not use a Graphical User Interface by default. Any RIPA
	account can be created offline and managed at no cost with a single device
	(computer, mobile phone, embedded ARM, IoT).
\end{description}

\section{Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets (BIP32)}
The structure of the public and private key generation follows the same specification
as Bitcoin. A custom implementation of BIP32 for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
is provided to RIPA users.

\section{Fees}
The fee for standard transactions is set at \PHP0.1 but the will be flexible in future releases of Ripa Blockchain.
At mainnet launch, a fee structure is provided out of the box to forging delegates with the following rules:
	\begin{description}
		\item - Transaction \PHP0.1
		\item - Vote \PHP1 (101 votes per transaction)
		\item - Second Signature \PHP1
		\item - Multi Signature \PHP1 per signature + \PHP1 per signing account
		\item - Registering a delegate \PHP25.
	\end{description}
All fees are paid to the forging node which processes the block containing those fees.

\section{Ripa Delegates and Delegate Voting}
Any node running the core blockchain code wishing to become a forging node must
register their account within the RIPA network. The fee for this registration is set to
25 \PHP per delegate account registered.
RIPA incorporates a new DPoS voting system originally envisioned by the Crypti
Founders. The RIPA system fee is 1 \PHP per delegate vote. The voting weight of each
wallet will be split evenly between all delegates voted. For example:
\begin{description}
	\item - If a wallet votes for one delegate, that delegate receives 100\% of the wallets
voting weight.
	\item - If that wallet votes for an additional delegate, the entire vote weight is split
evenly between the two delegates at 50\%.
	\item - By adding a third delegate, the voting weight splits again, and each of the
three delegates receives 33.333\% of the voting weight from that wallet.
\end{description}

The 101 forging nodes with the highest number of votes are eligible to Forge RIPA
blocks. This design eliminates the possibility that any single large RIPA holder or an
organization holding large percentages of RIPA are able to gain control over the
entire network by voting for all of their nodes into forging positions, thus effectively
taking complete control over that DPoS Blockchain. Votes from RIPA Tokens held by
RIPA Crew may be used at RIPA Crew's discretion.

\section{Connecting Blockchains}
\subsection{ARK Bridged Blockchains (SmartBridge Technology)}
The ARK Platform does not provide direct support for sidechains or dapp databases.
Instead, a mechanism to bridge together blockchains is provided via a bridging
function built into ARK Core where any blockchain can send and receive trigger
function notices and informational data through the primary ARK network via
custom developed \textbf{SmartBridge(s)} and \textbf{Encoded Listeners}.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{ARKSmartBridge}
	\captionof{figure}{ARK SmartBridge Technology}
\end{center}

\subsection{A.C.E.S. - ARK Contract Execution Service}
ACES is a blockchain interoperability platform that provides simple protocols and tools for building a robust blockchain 
service marketplace.

ACES is composed mainly of the following three components:
\begin{description}
	\item[Listeners] ACES Listeners provide a way for all the different blockchain transaction events to be easily 
	consumed via a common REST-ful API. The API allows consumers to create subscriptions and receive blockchain events 
	in real-time using Webhook callbacks.
	\item[Services] ACES Services create and excute Service Contracts, which can be anything from uploading 
	a file to a storage blockchain, performing value transfers, creating smart contracts, executing code on 
	blockchain based computing platforms, or interacting with IoT hardware.
	\item[Marketplace Console] The ACES Marketplace Console is a consumer dashboard for searching and executing 
	service contracts listed on the Marketplace. ACES Service providers can list their service nodes using the Marketplace API.
\end{description}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{ACES}
	\captionof{figure}{ARK-BTC A.C.E.S. SmartBridge Implementation Overview}
\end{center}

\section{Ripa Liquidity Service Provider (R.L.S.P)}
Using the SmartBridge technology RipaEx will build a mechanism to share liquidity between all the exchanges in the Ripa network
by writing the single exchange orderbook in the Ripa Blockchain and by executing order matching between all exchanges in the network.

In this way you can have the benefits of a decentralized orderbook (like liquidity) with the benefits of a centralized exchange (like
platinum customer support and FIAT exchange).

\section{Ripa Community Fund}
To permits the born of new exchanges in the Ripa network a Ripa Community Fund - RCF - is created with the following characteristics:
\begin{description}
	\item[Starting Principal]: the RCF will have a starting operating capital of 5\% (5,750,000 \PHP) of the genesis block
	\item[Recurring Participation]: each delegate will contribute to the RCF with 5\% of its forged XPXs
\end{description}

To obtain funds from the RCF to start your own Ripa Exchange you will submit your proposal in the official RCF section in the Ripa forum at
anytime after the first Ripa Exchange instance will be operative.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	CHAPTER 5: Token Sale
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapterimage{chapter_head_5_Tokyo.jpg} % Chapter heading image
\chapter{Token Sale}
\section{Introduction}
The RipaEx XPX token sale will be separated into two phases:
	\begin{description}
		\item[\textsc{PreSale}]: that will run from April to August 2018
		\item[\textsc{RIPA TEC}]: that will run from September to December 2018
	\end{description}

\subsection{Exchange Rate \& Accepted Cryptocurrencies}
During the token sale the exchange rate for the XPX tokens will be \textbf{\PHP/\euro0.10}.\\

The following cryptocurrencies are accepted: \textbf{BTC, ETH, ARK, LISK}.\\

If you want to send us a different cryptocurrency send us your choice and we will tell you immediately if we can make 
the exchange and how to execute the operation in detail (receiving address, exchange rate, quantity)\\

\textsc{Exchange rate is Bitstamp last and is valid 60 minutes from quote}.

\section{How to Invest}
\subsection{XPX Ripa Token PreSale}
Private sale of XPX tokens has \textbf{started on Monday 04/02/2018 at 00:00 GMT and will end on Sunday 09/30/2018 at 23:59 GMT}.

You can buy directly here: 
\begin{center}
	\href{https://www.ripaex.io/privsale}{www.ripaex.io/privsale}
\end{center}

or send us your buying enquiries on our social Slack, Telegram, Facebook, Twitter or on other social networks where we are present.
For all the duration of the private sale period every exchange operation \textbf{will receive a 100\% bonus on its sending amount
until the first 5.000.000 XPX tokens} have been exchanged and will receive a 50\% bonus thereafter.

\subsection{RIPA TEC}
Fundraising through the RIPA TEC platform will follow the schedule:
\begin{description}
	\item[from 10/01/2018 00:00 to 10/14/2018 23:59]: 50\% 
	\item[from 10/15/2018 00:00 to 10/28/2018 23:59]: 40\% 
	\item[from 10/29/2018 00:00 to 11/11/2018 23:59]: 30\% 
	\item[from 11/12/2018 00:00 to 11/25/2018 23:59]: 20\% 
	\item[from 11/26/2018 00:00 to 12/09/2018 23:59]: 10\% 
	\item[from 12/10/2018 00:00 to 12/23/2018 23:59]: 5\% 
\end{description}
Coins distribution will be available at the end of each trading day and performed automatically through the RIPA TEC platform. Minimum
threshold to reach is 25 BTC.\\

\textsc{As the XPX exchange rate is calculated against the euro currency directly you are guaranteed to not loose any invested fund
during the sale period as the XPX tokens will be listed on our exchanges at the beginning of 2019 directly with the same \textbf{\PHP/\euro0.10}
exchange rate agreed during the token sale-ICO phase}.

\section{XPX Ripa Token Distribution}
\textbf{115,000,000} XPX tokens are seeded into the genesis block: distribution of the XPX tokens generated are described into
